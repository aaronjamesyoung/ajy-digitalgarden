My current everyday backpack is an [REI Co-op Ruckpack 28](https://www.rei.com/product/176900/rei-co-op-ruckpack-28-recycled-daypack-mens?color=BLACK) (although I think mine is an older generation than the one linked). I've had it a few years and it's held up really well. But it's starting to show some wear, and it has a few annoyances that I think I can do better with.

I'd like to make a new everyday backpack.

## Usage

My college cross country coach carried a backpack which he referred to as his "office". The pack should be tough enough to go anywhere with me for a long time.

* Toss in car
* Bike commuting
    * Including in wet conditions (but, Bend doesn't get too wet)
* One bag to pack for road trips
    * But, one of my annoyances with the REI pack is that it's a bit large and doesn't hold its shape well when not full
* Work

## Brainstorm

* It should carry my stuff
    * Laptop
        * Charging Cable
        * Mouse
    * Spare office key
    * Sunglasses cleaning cloth
    * Extra grocery bag
    * Notebook
    * Pen / pencil
    * Spork
    * knife
    * packable rain cover
* Features
    * Relatively tough. All weather, constant daily use. My REI pack has really been pretty good in this regard.
    * Make a packable rain cover
        * Can use waterproof zippers IF rain cover doesn't seem adequate, but don't need to worry too much about waterproofing the pack otherwise
        * Bend is not wet
    * Integrated detachable pouches? Make it easy to grab one or two components to take with me
* Consider plane carryon size limits, not that I intend to travel by plane
* Drawbacks of REI pack to fix
    * Brain design
    * Doesn't stand
    * Cannot grab water bottle while wearing (not sure if I can fix this one)
    * heavy
    * Deforms a bit when not full
    * Capacity is a bit larger than I normally need, but sometimes I fill it up
    * Side pockets are a bit inconvenient to use

    * how would it be to open the pack to just try and get in one of the accessory pouches, but not remove the caddy? LIke if I had a bunch of other stuff in main compartment?
