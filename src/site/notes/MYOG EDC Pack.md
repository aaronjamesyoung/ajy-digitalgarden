[[üìò MYOG\|üìò MYOG]]

My current everyday backpack is an [REI Co-op Ruckpack 28](https://www.rei.com/product/176900/rei-co-op-ruckpack-28-recycled-daypack-mens?color=BLACK) (although I think mine is an older generation than the one linked). I've had it a few years and it's held up really well. But it's starting to show some wear, and it has a few annoyances that I think I can do better with.

I'd like to make a new everyday backpack.

[Pro-level zippers for your gear projects the easy way ü§ê - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjf7XQ08I-c) - use technique 2 for both my continuous zippers. Separate bottom panel.

## Purchase

* 55" - 60" separating zipper, big, one pull
* 5 feet coil zipper, big, 3 pulls
* Shoulder strap foam
* Power mesh

## Sizing

* Back/front panel: 10.5 x 17
* Depth: 4.5" expand to 7"
    * ?

## Features

* Clamshell opening
* Laptop sleeve
* Foam back panel
* Power mesh front pocket
* Internal organization
* Packable rain cover
* Consider internal detachable pouches - if convenient & useful

## Usage

My college cross country coach carried a backpack which he referred to as his "office". The pack should be tough enough to go anywhere with me for a long time.

* Toss in car
* Bike commuting
    * Including in wet conditions (but, Bend doesn't get too wet)
* One bag to pack for road trips
    * But, one of my annoyances with the REI pack is that it's a bit large and doesn't hold its shape well when not full
* Work

## Brainstorm

* It should carry my stuff
    * Laptop
        * Charging Cable
        * Mouse
    * Spare office key
    * Sunglasses cleaning cloth
    * Extra grocery bag
    * Notebook
    * Pen / pencil
    * Spork
    * knife
    * packable rain cover
* Drawbacks of REI pack to fix
    * Brain design
    * Doesn't stand
    * Cannot grab water bottle while wearing (not sure if I can fix this one)
    * heavy
    * Deforms a bit when not full
    * Capacity is a bit larger than I normally need, but sometimes I fill it up
    * Side pockets are a bit inconvenient to use
