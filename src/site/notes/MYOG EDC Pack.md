I'd like to make a new everyday backpack.

## Brainstorm

* It should carry my stuff
    * Laptop, cords
    * (sometimes) second laptop, cords
    * work tablet, cord
    * Notebook
    * Pen pouch
    * Toiletries pouch
* Features
    * Relatively tough. All weather, constant daily use. My REI pack has really been pretty good in this regard.
    * Make a packable rain cover, but don't worry about waterproofing the pack otherwise
        * Bend is not wet
    * Integrated detachable pouches?
* Drawbacks of REI pack to fix
    * Brain design
    * Doesn't stand
    * Cannot grab water bottle while wearing
    * heavy
    * Deforms a bit when not full
    * Capacity is a bit larger than I normally need, but sometimes I fill it up

## Inspiration

* [r/myog - Blue EDC pack w/ workbench pocket](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/geu2um/blue_edc_pack_w_workbench_pocket/) - I really like this design
* [r/myog - Full Zip EDC Pack #2 VX21 Blue/Black/Gray](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/9f1kpt/full_zip_edc_pack_2_vx21_blueblackgray/)
* [r/myog - Made a LS21/VX21 EDC Pack for university](https://www.reddit.com/r/myog/comments/99znpk/made_a_ls21vx21_edc_pack_for_university/)
* [backpack BC 18 -](http://andersj.se/backpack-bc-18/) - quite a different design
