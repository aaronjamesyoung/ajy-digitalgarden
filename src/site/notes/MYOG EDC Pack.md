[[ðŸ“˜ MYOG\|ðŸ“˜ MYOG]]

I made an everyday backpack. This was a learning experience and my next one would (will?) be quite a bit better.

## Features

* Padded straps and a sternum strap
* Water bottle holder for my 1L Hydroflask bottle
* Side pocket for small flat items (phone/wallet)
* Front workbench pocket
* Ample inner organization
* Separating zipper to expand capacity
* Full clamshell opening

## Fabrics

* Black 1000D cordura. While this stuff is burly, it's probably overkill and was hard on my sewing machine when I was dealing with more than a few layers.
* Blue 100D Robic Nylon from Ripstop By the Roll. This stuff is good, but relatively thin and floppy. It has worked very well in trail running packs.
* Power Mesh: Used for internal organization pockets. It's very thin, and I always double it up. I think using two layers makes a big difference with the durability of this mesh.

## Inspiration credit

Though my pack is nowhere near as good as any of these.
