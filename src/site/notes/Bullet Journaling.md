## What is Bullet Journaling?

Bullet Journaling is a method of managing a personal calendar, planner, and journal with a focus on rapid logging - using terse bulleted statements to record your thoughts in real time and allow you to expand on them later. Bullet journaling proper is done in a physical notebook but there are many ways to set up a digital bullet journal in an app such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## How to Bullet Journal

* Start with inexpensive materials - any old pen and notebook that you already have.
    * I find myself more motivated to write in a nicer notebook. The [Black Dot Journal by Artist's Loft](https://www.michaels.com/black-dot-journal-by-artists-loft/10597670.html) notebook from Michael's is only $7 and is good quality.
    * I prefer a dot grid notebook
* Start with the simplest implementation that makes sense

    * Since I depend on Google Calendar for sharing events with my wife and coworkers, I find the monthly event view to be unhelpful (although creating a monthy "focuses" view can be valuable time spent recentering myself for the upcoming month).
    * I am best at this when I focus on daily rapid logging as my main function for the journal.
* Don't overcomplicate, but add components like collections and long-form journaling as you go.

### A suggested starting place

Start with:

* An index
* Daily notes in order at the front of the notebook
* Topical collections starting from the back of the notebook. Number your pages B1, B2, B3 from the back for indexing purposes.

## What I do

I use a hybrid of physical and digital notebooks. My daily notes and brainstorming go in my physical notebook, but my topical notes (eventually) go in my digital notebook.

* I use these Bullet Journal components:
    * **Index** - I use two 2-page spreads. The first index spread is for my dated material that starts at the front of the notebook and the pages are numbered 1, 2, 3 as normal. The second index spread is for collections that start at the end of the notebook and pages are numbered B1, B2, B3 starting from the back.
    * **Master Task List (Weekly)** - This is the least bullet-journal'y thing I do. Each week I write a master task list for things I need to get done this week. I can refer to it all week long. If I come up with new tasks to be done in future weeks, I put them at the bottom of the page.
    * **Daily view** - Each day I write the tasks & events for the day and I rapid-log notes throughout the day including new events and tasks to schedule for a later date. For example, if I schedule an appointment for two weeks in the future, I'll note it in my rapid log and migrate it to my calendar at the end of the day.
        * All notes for the day are rapid-logged. This includes:
            * Thoughts and feelings
            * Reminders
            * Notes from meetings and appointments during the day
        * I use a checkbox for tasks, a dot bullet for notes, and a circle for events.
            * I don't overwrite my bullets with new symbols like in the video above.
            * If an event or task is complete, or a note is no longer relevant, I cross out the whole line.
            * If an event, task, or note needs to be migrated to the next day, or a different system, or a collection, I prepend the bullet with an arrow and potentially a page number where the migration will be executed.
        * At the end of the day I perform a **migration**. I review my notes for the day and either cross out or migrate all the notes in my rapid log.
            * New events go into my calendar
            * Incomplete and new daily tasks go into the next day's note.
            * Topical thoughts go into the appropriate collection at the end of the notebook.
            * Some notes allow me to do some long-form journaling. This goes at the end of the daily log before I begin the log for the following day.
    * **Collections in physical journal** - I occasionally write topical, undated notes in my physical notebook. These can be compilations of journaled thoughts on a subject, project management overviews, shopping lists, reference notes, etc. They start at the back of the journal and are generally sketches or brainstorming when I don't have my computer handy, and are often migrated into my digital notebook.
        * My collections are at the end of my notebook to not break up the daily logs. The first collection goes at the end of the notebook and the page is numbered B1. I try to leave extra pages for collections if I feel they may expand, but this isn't a perfect art. Sometimes I may need to continue a collection on a non-consecutive page.
        * In my daily notes I can refer to collections using a page number.
        * In fact, I try to create two-way links between my dailies and collections when relevant so I can easily refer to one from the other.
    * **Collections in digital notebook** - I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for collections / topical notes.
        * Obsidian can also do daily notes using templates and I've used this. It has some advantages like making personal trackers and easily interlinking notes.
        * Some of my notes are published on my website in a [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] format. Others are kept more private.
