Brainstorming prior to launching my digital garden-style website in Nov 2022.

## Digital Garden Info & Resources

* [Digital Gardens](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/)
* [🪴 Quartz 3.](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
* [GitHub - secure-77/Perlite: A web-based markdown viewer optimized for Obsidian](https://github.com/secure-77/Perlite)
* [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)
    * [Janik Vonrotz - Obsidian and Vuepress: include markdown files](https://janikvonrotz.ch/2021/10/29/obsidian-and-vuepress-include-markdown-files/)
* [Static Site Generators: any guides? - Resolved help - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/static-site-generators-any-guides/8915/8)
* [Understanding digital garden creation with Obsidian - Knowledge management - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/understanding-digital-garden-creation-with-obsidian/2725)
* [GitHub - MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners: Resources, links, projects, and ideas for gardeners tending their digital notes on the public interwebs](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
    * A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.

## Things to include?

* Blog posts: lengthier writing, thoughts, or narrative on a subject
* Short-form status updates
* Subject matter notes
* Photos
* Strava
* Evergreen notes - Subject matter writing

## Tech

* Flowershow is simple
    * - No Dataview support
    * - No backlinks
* [GitHub - oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) supports all the stuff
    * Chrono feeds? Could be done with Dataview
    * Template requires some customization but that's OK
    * Set up to auto publish to Github
    * Requires manual publish

## Writing & Notetaking Strategy

* [BACKLINK oriented NOTE-TAKING - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13CP3zfbNJeTMzMyglqYFZdldzIduUrJ0KrMooQN8yuo/edit#)
    * Pages: MOC's - but remove info, these should just be links
    * Notes - this is where the info is, link back to pages liberally
    * Don't be afraid to split notes into more granular info, especially if it could apply in multiple situations. For example, sewing techniques
        * Notes could be transcluded
    * Main goal: Notes should be evergreen
