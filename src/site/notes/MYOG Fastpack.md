I started from the Stitchback PZ pattern but made some changes.

* Pack height is less so it doesn't bump hip / butt. I got it right but would need to measure vs the pattern to tell exactly how much I shortened it. Do this and note here.
  * Affects piece A, B, C, D, E
  * While doing this I changed piece C to a simple rect. But don't do this; keep C as conceptually patterned, but shorten the sides as much as is feasible. This makes the bottom corners much easier to sew.
* Pack depth is 1" less than patterned.
  * Affects piece A, B, C
* Back pocket is squared off at top and uses two straps over the top
  * Affects piece A and top strap attachments on piece (D? F?)
  * I also put on webbing loops to hold straps in place when going over a higher-ish load. These are well placed and do their job, but are ugly on my pack. Figure out a better way of accomplishing this.
* Straps are different. Use traditional (but different shaped) foam straps over shoulders, transition to vest straps over chest.
  * I have pattern pieces for these saved
  * Foam straps should be 1" or even 2" longer. Check and decide.
  * I could benefit from figuring out better suspension techniques. It feels like I have to adjust the straps a bit tight, particularly at bottom, to keep pack from sliding down.
  * On the vest part of the straps, I got the measurements and pocket builds really good. Perfectly holds water flasks and they are easy to slip in.
* In the future I might like to contour the pack a bit more to move forward a bit at top (so it's not sticking out backwards)
