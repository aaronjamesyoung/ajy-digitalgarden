[[Genesis 37\|Genesis 37]] 17-28-Joseph & his brothers

* In the last part of Genesis, Joseph's story is a microcosm of the whole book.
* Genesis doesn't just chronicle events - it tells us how to think about the world.
* 37:4- Joseph's brothers hate him. This is thematic in Genesis, even back to Cain + Abel.
* 37:26 Sounds like they weren't planning to follow Reuben's plan- They are still discussing killing Joseph.
* From here to end of Genesis- Joseph has ascents & descents- literal and metaphorical. God was always with him.x
* God was also with the brothers this whole time. He has brought about a change. At the end, Judah is willing to serve as a slave in Benjamin's place.
* This is made possible by Joseph's forgiveness. [[Genesis 45\|Genesis 45]] 4-5 - "It was to save lives that God sent me here.

How does God work in the world?

* God did not make the brothers sin. But God orchestrated these actions for His purposes.
* Joseph doesn't overlook the pain and hurt he has through. But the presence of God has enabled him to forgive his brothers.
* Forgiveness is rarely what we deserve.
* We don't forgive because it benefits us. We do it to imitate Christ who first forgave us.

The Kingdom is coming- where we forgive those who have been hurting us, offend us, voted differently than us, etc.

The way of Jesus is not about being right or holding the upper hand. Choosing to forgive will advance the kingdom of God.
