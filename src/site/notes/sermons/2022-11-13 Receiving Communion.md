[[94-bible/John 6\|John 6]] 47-58

* Communion is the goal of the service - act of union w/ God

## Relationship

* [[94-bible/Genesis 2\|Genesis 2]] - We are created for relationship. In Gen 3-11, we then see several episodes of alienation - from God, each other, etc.
* But in [[94-bible/Genesis 12\|Genesis 12]] God begins the work of Reconciliation
* The reconciliation of all things is not a thing we can do as individuals. Only way we can do this is by being nourished by the flesh & blood of Christ. John 6
* Right vs wrong way to take communion: [[94-bible/1 Corinthians 11\|1 Corinthians 11]]
    * It's about relationship primarily. We need to check the status of our relationships: God, self, others, creation
* We're hungry, so we eat. We're thirsty, so we drink. Missionally we are nourished by Him if we are to participate in His mission, the reconciliation of all things.
* We need to be reminded that our lives are about relationship.
* We eat this meal together because so many of our meals are in isolation.
