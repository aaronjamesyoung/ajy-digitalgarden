[[94-bible/Psalm 15\|Psalm 15]]

* v1 - "sacred tent" = tabernacle. Holy mountain = temple.
    * Arguably more space in scripture is given to the tabernacle design than any other subject. So it's worth paying attention to.
    * We see God's attention to detail
    * God's holiness doesn't keep him from being with sinful people. The tabernacle & temple is God drawing near us despite our sinfulness.
    * Who can be there? Priests. This psalm may havebeen used as an entrance liturgy, as people come in the temple. Call (v1) and response (vv 2-5a)
    * This is a question to God, a prayer. We can pray our questions to God. Be honest.
        * Most contemporary worship songs miss this and do not pose questions to God
* vv 2-5a - the answer to the question
    * This is a description of the kind of community God is trying to build.
    * This should draw our attention to how we have been living our lives. Similar to our prayer of confession. Every person would be convicted that they're not worthy to enter presence of God. So, fix it! For them, they would off er a sacrifice and move forrward to worship and enter into communion with God.
* Jesus is the new temple, the new high priest, and the new sacrifice. See [[94-bible/Hebrews 10\|Hebrews 10]] vv 11-14, 19-22
