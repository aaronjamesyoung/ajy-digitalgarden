Second Sunday of Easter, 2023

[[94-bible/Acts 2\|Acts 2]] v14a, 22-33

* This is Peter's sermon on the day of Pentecost, in Acts 2.
* Verse 22-24 - Peter grounds everything in the resurrection. [[94-bible/1 Corinthians 15\|1 Corinthians 15]] v14
	* Early church struggling with what exactly had happened
	* Peter points out that the resurrection was God's plan from the start.
* Verse 25-28 - Quote from [[94-bible/Psalm 16\|Psalm 16]]
	* A psalm of David. Describes one who died but will not be abandoned to death.
	* Peter says: This psalm is not about David - he's dead. The psalm is about the Messiah - jesus.
	* Peter chose this psalm because it points out the body is not decaying
		* The resurrection is physical, not only spiritual.
* Verse 32 - we are all witnesses.
	* We have been charged to testify to the death and resurrection of Jesus, by our lives.
* Resurrection happens today - Because Christ ahs been resurrected, so are we, his ollowers.
	* Compost is a good metaphor: Food scraps that are destined waste or d eath are given new life.
	* When Jesus was resurrected, he was given new life, not just going to his old life. He was not destined to grow old and die again, like Lazarus. We are given this same type of resurrection in a spiritual sense.
