[[94-bible/Psalm 40\|Psalm 40]] verses 1-11 - Dr. Gerry Breshears

* Let's check verses 12-13 first. Note, the author is still in the "pit"! He has been throughout this psalm and we should read it with that in mind.
* vv 1-3 - At the beginning, the author is in a bad situation, but patiently waiting for God - with hope, even as it takes time.
    * Author declares the truth about God even as he may not feel it
* vv 4-5 - Author is reminding self o fthe good things God has done, looking around at the beauty of all the things God has made. Actively seeing.
* vv 6-8
    * Verse 6: "but my ears you have opened" - this phrase breaks the poetic parallel structure. Draws our attention. This is quoted in [[94-bible/Hebrews 10\|Hebrews 10]] vv 5-6, and is applied to Jesus there. "A body you prepared for me" is the Septuagint translation.
    * "Sacrifice not required" - meaning author is not going to try to bribe God - instead he will continue waiting for God patiently.
* vv 9-10 - I proclaim God's goodness even in the circumstances
* verse 11 - again asking God to deliver, while all this is still happening.

Frames of reference - three different views of evil:

* God ordains evil for his greater glory and our ultimate good (Calvinist)
* God allows us to choose evil for the sake of true loving relationship (Arminian)
* God is at war with evil, using Good as His primary weapon (mix)
