[[94-bible/John 9\|John 9]] vv 1-12 - 4th Sunday of Lent

* John refers to "signs" instead of "miracles", indicating the intent behind the actions
* Signs are often accompanied by "I am" statements (i.e., v 5)
* Three relationships that Jesus is bringing light to in this story
    * Relationships with one another
        * v2: "Who sinned" Nobody. This is a way for people to try to exercise agency over their circumstances
        * We don't know why the man was blind. But Jesus showed that we are to move toward him instead of trying to judge him or regard him with fear.
    * Relationship with creation
        * We are part of creation
        * Jesus uses creation in this healing. See also [[94-bible/Genesis 2\|Genesis 2]] v7
        * Remember not to elevate the spiritual above the physical. We are both.
    * Relationship with Jesus
        * From conversion, we should continue to grow and know him differently today.
        * Our lives should look different because of Jesus.
    * These three relationships are intertwined.
