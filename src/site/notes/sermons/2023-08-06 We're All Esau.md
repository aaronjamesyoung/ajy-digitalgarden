Jacob & Esau - [[Genesis 25\|Genesis 25]] vv 19-34

* Abraham's family is a mess. This is common in Genesis and throughout scripture.
* Remember, not everything in the Bible is Biblical. Describe vs Prescribe.

* Jacob & Esau are described as caricatures, exaggerated stereotypes.
* Birthright: Jacob is still grasping, as at birth
* v34: Not that he despised his birthright after this, but he gave it away because he didn't value it in the first place.

So how about us?

* Short term decision vs long term consequences.
* Point of the story is: We're all Esau.
	* [[Hebrews 12\|Hebrews 12]] v16 uses Esau as an example in the area of sexuality. We are not to devalue our bodies in the way Esau devalued his birthright.
	* Author of Hebrews is gently and gracefully warning his hearers.

* In NT, what is sexual immorality? Where / how is it defined?
	* There are no real model marriages in Scripture
	* So look at how Jesus loved & what he taught.
		* Jesus spoke frequently on these things.
		* [[Matthew 19\|Matthew 19]] vv 4-5: Jesus refers [[94-bible/Genesis 1\|Genesis 1]] and [[94-bible/Genesis 2\|Genesis 2]] as containing God's design for marriage. Thus, immorality is what falls outside.
* All have sinned in this area. We are all guilty of sexual immorality- All of us are Esau. Jesus takes sexual sin seriously.
* Jesus invites all of us as we are. He is more concerned about where we are going than where we've been.
* Christian life isn't about morality. It's about being called to Jesus.
