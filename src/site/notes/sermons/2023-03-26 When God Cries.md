[[John 11\|John 11]] v 18-28, 32-45 - Resurrection of Lazarus

* This is the 7th and greatest sign in John's gospel.
* Mary & Martha have very different ways of grieving according to their personalities. Jesus works with each of them.
* v21 and v32 - each say to Jesus, if you had been here, Lazarus would not have died.
    * Where's God when things go wrong?
    * v33-35 - Jesus is deeply moved and troubled - he is there.
* v35 - Why is Jesus weeping? He knows how this will turn out.
    * Jesus' human nature
    * But also, God is emotional
    * If we want to know what God is like, look at Jesus
* If we want to love as God loves, grieve as God grieves
    * [[1 Thessalonians 4\|1 Thessalonians 4]] v13-14 - Grieve as those with hope (not "don't grieve"). Know that death doesn't get the last word.
    * Jesus is our hope. John 11 v25-26
