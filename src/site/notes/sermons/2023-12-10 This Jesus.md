* Third Sunday of Easter
* [[94-bible/Acts 2\|Acts 2]] v36-41
* Verse 41 - 3,000 were baptized. What was it that made this religion spread so quickly?
	* First christians were fearless martyrs. Peace in facing death.
	* Christians were more inclusive than other religions, especially toward the poor and oppressed.
	* Christians loved better than others, including those outside the faith
* Why did the early Christians do these things?
	* a "burst of energy" which is what we're looking at over the past few weeks - the resurrection of Christ and the Holy Spirit empowering the church.
* Verse 36 - Declaration that Jesus is the Messiah
	* "whom you crucified"
	* [[Matthew 27\|Matthew 27]] Pilate asks "Which Jesus do you want?" Acts 2:36 "This Jesus"
	* Since then, we make Jesus to be who we want. We choose Jesus who looks like us physically, politically, idealogically.
	* "Nailed to the cross" - in this state, Jesus is "saving our sins" but incapable of ruling us (our Savior, not our Lord).
* Verse 37 - Christ lives again
