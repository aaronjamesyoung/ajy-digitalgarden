[[The Whole Gospel\|The Whole Gospel]]

[[94-bible/2 Timothy 3\|2 Timothy 3]] vv 14-17

* The Whole Truth of Scripture - human authorship and divine authority. We should not overemphasize the human or divine aspects of this relationship.
* Christianity contains some apparent contradictions / paradoxes:
	* Jesus is fully human and fully divine
	* God is three-in-one
	* etc
* Scripture is the wod of God. But the human authors and contexts matter for our own interpretation of Scripture.

### How does scripture refer to itself?

* [[94-bible/Mark 12\|Mark 12]] vv 35-36 - Jesus' phrasing "David himself, in the Holy Spirit"
* [[94-bible/2 Peter 2\|2 Peter 2]] vv 20-21 - Peter's explanation of this dichotomy
* [[94-bible/2 Peter 3\|2 Peter 3]] vv 15-16 - Peter attests to God's inspiration of Paul's letters
	* Paul attests to Luke as well [[94-bible/1 Timothy 5\|1 Timothy 5]] v18 (quoting [[94-bible/Luke 10\|Luke 10]] v7)
* Sometimes scripture is dictated to people directly by God, most often in the Prophets. Mostly other methods. For example, [[94-bible/Luke 1\|Luke 1]] vv 1-3 describe Luke's process of investigation

### Pitfalls of overemphasizing the divine authority of scripture

* Verse-picking - we may ignore context of longer passages to misinterpret a particular verse
* Biblicism - says all we can know is what Scripture says (though Scripture itself does not claim this [[94-bible/Romans 1\|Romans 1]] vv 18-23)
* Reading our context into scripture - the historical and human context matters and even a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew are helpful

### Pitfalls of overemphasizing the human authorship of scripture

* Reduces Bible study to academics. We can focus too much on the study, and miss the message that God is giving us.
* Can lead to rejection of divine authority
* We should consider the human context when reading. But we should also pray for divine guidance while reading scripture.
