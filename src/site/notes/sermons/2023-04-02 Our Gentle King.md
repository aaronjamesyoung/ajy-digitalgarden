* [[94-bible/Matthew 21\|Matthew 21]] vv 1-11 - Palm Sunday
* We know what Palm Sunday is, but are less familiar with what it means.

1. Jesus is at the end of a long walking trip
2. Jerusalem had 50k residents but was packed far above capacity at Passover
3. To this point Jesus has been working under-the-radar, mostly.

[[94-bible/Zechariah 9\|Zechariah 9]] v9, [[94-bible/Zechariah 14\|Zechariah 14]] v4 - Jesus has been asking for a donkey. The disciples may be connecting the dots with this passage. other messiah figures had done this during the Roman occupation before Jesus, but Jesus was unique - [[94-bible/Matthew 9\|Matthew 9]] v3.

* Jesus didn't hush the crowd.
* Pilate had made a (much more) triumphant entry the same week. Jesus' entry is deliberately subversive:
    * Nonviolent [[📘 Christian Nonviolence\|📘 Christian Nonviolence]]
    * Public performance meant to get attention, challenge values and norms.
    * A different, gentle way to draw attention.
* Message: The Kingdom of God is here. Jesus shows what the Kingdom is like:
    * Strength in self-control
    * Gentle in actions and words
    * Gentleness is an expression of God's love for the world.
