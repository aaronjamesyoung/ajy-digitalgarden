Michelle Jones, pastor from Imago Dei. 2nd Sunday of Lent

[[94-bible/John 3\|John 3]] vv 1-17

* v1 - Nicodemus: a Pharisee, and also a politician.
* v2 - Came by night. Why? Symbolic. He's in the dark. Don't overanalyze his reasons for coming at night
* v3 - Jesus' answer seems different than Nicodemus' question. Nicodemus comes with knowledge, but Jesus answers his need. Nicodemus' answer indicates he is expecting this
* v4 - How can someone be born again? The kingdom conversation is clearly the conversation Nicodemus wanted. So, what do I do to get into the kingdom?
* vv 5-8 - Jesus clarifies. You can't work your way in or expect that a behavior will get it in
    * v8 - Just as you cannot control the wind, so you cannot control the Spirit.
        * [[94-bible/2 Corinthians 5\|2 Corinthians 5]] v17 - born again, new creation
        * [[94-bible/Ezekiel 36\|Ezekiel 36]] - vv 25-27. Rebirth through water and spirit. note, Nicodemus would have been aware of this text.
* v9 - Nicodemus - "huh?" Jesus is giving him imagery he should be familiar with. You can't save yourself unless you go beyond yourself. Example: rich young ruler. what would it be difficult to part wth to follow Jesus?
    * Nicodemus wants the kingdom on his terms with a God he can impress. Jesus insists you cannot buy or earn the kingdom.
* vv 11-13 - What can you do? You can trust me. Over the course of this passage, Jesus gets clearer and more explicit
    * Augustine: "The jews looked upon a serpent to be freed from serpents, and we look upon the death of Christ to be freed from death"
* vv 16-17 - John stops quoting Jesus. Focus shifts from the story, to the listener.
