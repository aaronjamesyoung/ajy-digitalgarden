[[94-bible/Matthew 2\|Matthew 2]] vv 13-23 - The slaughter of the innocents

* Contextually note that a recurring theme of scripture is the idea of the clash of earthly vs heavenly kingdoms. This is what's happening in this passage
* Jesus was born into a world where hideous despots were willing to go to desparate lengths to maintain power. In short, a world like ours today. We continue to experience life as a clash between kingdoms.
* Which kingdom do we find ourselves aligned with/
    * Herod: Control, money, power
    * Jesus: Giving, sacrificial love
* New year: what is God asking us to remove from our lives this year? (instead of add)
    * Something from our schedule? budget? prominence in our thoughts/feelings?
    * Consider removing big things from our lives. Trust God
