[[The Whole Gospel\|The Whole Gospel]]

[[94-bible/Acts 1\|Acts 1]] v1-11

The Whole Gospel - final sermon in series. As a church, if we are to be faithful to God and our faith, we cannot be defined by cultural divisions in the church.

* The Kingdom of God - Acts 1:3 - Jesus spoke about the Kingdom of God.
	* What does Jesus mean? Kingdom of God = Kingdom of Heaven
	* He talks about the kingdom as it is experienced in this world, so we're not just talking about heaven.
* What? Where? When? Will there be cats?
	* **What?** A kingdom ruled by God. Jews were hopoing that God would remove Rome and rule on Earth. But God's Kingdom is not of this world (Pilate). It does not work like a kingdom of the world with violence and power.
	* **Where?** "in your midst", "near", "Good News". But not of this world!
	* **When?** We asak this like the disciples - Acts 1:16 - Hast the time come to restore Israel? Jesus doesn't really clarify this.
		* [[94-bible/Luke 17\|Luke 17]] It is in your midst, but coming and cannot be observed.
* So, the Kingdom is here, ad not here yet. We do have a framework for understanding this:
	* A new pianist is not an experienced pianist yet
	* The Kingdom is here but not perfected
	* We are to invest time, effort, etc to practice to bring about the Kingdom more fully.
* What does it look like to help bring about the Kingdom?
	* Shepherd's House - we show love, compassion, and dignity without expecting anything in return (even conversions).
	* Gun decommissioning
	* Medical respite lodging
* **Who?** The disciples ask Jesus for the Kingdom, but he gives them the Spirit (Acts 1:8)
	* the Holy Spirit was central to Jesus' life and ministry
	* The Spirit gives us the power to share Gospel with others and to bring about the Kingdom.
* Maybe the Kingdom means letting the Spirit lead us to care for those on teh margins.
