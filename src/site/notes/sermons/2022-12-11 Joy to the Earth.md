[[94-bible/Isaiah 35\|Isaiah 35]] vv 1-10

* This passage prophesies Jesus' second coming and the establishment of God's Kingdom. v 10 mentions humanity but much of the passage focuses on the rest of creation.
* As American Christians, especially from an evangelical background, we tend not to talk about creation much. 2 reasons:
    * *theological* - we have a mistaken theology that the earth is cursed and fleeting. 
    * *political* - Discussing creation care associates us with the "wrong" tribe
* But, we should discuss this as Christians. Why? Reconciliation with nature from a Biblical point of view (not theological or political).
    * [[94-bible/Genesis 1\|Genesis 1]] v1 - Bible begins with a Creator and Creation
        * Creation and the Creator are not the same
    * [[94-bible/Genesis 1\|Genesis 1]] v31 - What does God say about creation? It is "very good".
        * This is not an assessment. It is a pronouncement.
        * We are created in God's image. We should view creation as valuable the way God does.
    * [[94-bible/Genesis 2\|Genesis 2]] v15 - God invites humanity into the world to care for it. If we accept that creation is important to God, we should steward it wisely. To abuse creation is to devalue it, but God has pronounced it very good.
    * [[94-bible/Romans 8\|Romans 8]] v22 - "whole creation groaning" - we have failed in our stewardship of creation, Paul notes it is corrupted by our sin. The world is not how it is supposed to be.
        * Note: Pacific ocean garbage island - look, even *if* there's debate about whether climate change is human-caused (I do not concede that there is meaningful debate about that, but suppose there is), there's no question that the garbage island is on us.
    * [[94-bible/Revelation 21\|Revelation 21]] - God WILL redeem creation. This is what Isaiah is describing in [[94-bible/Isaiah 35\|Isaiah 35]]
* As we anticipate Christmas, this is the gospel story we are entering into. 
* Ideas for a green Christmas:
    * Buy less and buy local. Shared experiences instead of things - concert tickets, etc
    * Get outside - spend time in creation
    * Give thanks before meals - say grace - recognize God's provision in all areas of life
    * Practice Sabbath - especially during the busy part of the year, take time for what's not work
