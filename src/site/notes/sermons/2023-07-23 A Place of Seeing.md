Sean. 8th Sunday of Sunmartide. [[Genesis 16\|Genesis 16]] vv 1-16 Hager. 

* Scripture can be complicated and messy, because the people are complicated & messy. Scripture is not about ideals: it's about reality
* What does faith look like in a God whose promises tarry too long?
* Is it fair to say Sarah's motivation is due to distrusting God?
	* She may be motivated to bring about the promised child. This was an acceptable way to establish a legitimate linage at the time.
	* Sarah's infertility was likely painful for her.
	* Sarah deserves our grace.
* Hager looked w/ contempt due to a change is dynamic.
	* Sarah Mistreated Hager as badly as the Israelites were treated in Egypt later.
* Hagar - 1st person to get angelic messenger in Scripture.
	* "Ishmael" God listens. God has listened to Hagar..
* Bad interpretation: Muslims us Jews. Remember Hebrew poetry - each line restates & builds on the previous.
	* "Wild Donkey" - Ishmael will be free, not a slave like Hagar
	* His hand free from everyone, everyone's hand free from him.
	* He will live in. the presence of all his kin.
* This makes Hagar's response which more reasonable.
* Hgar (uniquely) gives God a name: God of Seeing.
* Paralells between Abram & Hagar.
	* God's promise
	* Promise of descendants
	* Procure wife for child
	* Naming of place

This isn't a pretty text. Glosses over intertility and a slave is raped & abused.

Hope for victims. God still listens and sees victims. We too should listen and see victims. We are a part of redeeming all things
