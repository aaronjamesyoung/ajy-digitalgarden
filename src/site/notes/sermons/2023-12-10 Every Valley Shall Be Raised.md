[[94-bible/Isaiah 40\|Isaiah 40]] v1-11

Second Sunday of Advent

* Advent is a season of waiting. It is a time that we are honest that God can seem far away.
* Our cultural conception of Christmas is nostalgic, looking backward and focused on tradition. But Advent is the opposite of this: Looking forward to God showing up.
* Isaiah 1-39 are warnings of judgement coming and calls to repent. We think there's a 150-yr gap from Is 39-Is 40. Babylon has invaded and israel has been in exile 70 years.
* Isaiah 40 is offering comfort to the people, instead of warning and rebuke.
* v2: "Her hard service has been completed"
* v3: "A voice cries" - What will it look like when God arrives? Highway metaphor: Ground levled ot to make way for the coming of the Lord.
* Martin Luther King, Jr. quoted this passage in his "I have a dream" speech. Why?
	* Verse 3 is referenced in [[94-bible/Luke 3\|Luke 3]] v4-5 when Jesus' arrival is being announced by John the Baptist. John is the last of the OT prophetic tradition. He is preparing the way for Christ.
	* Luke 3:5 - Justice is coming - God is going to raise those who are low, and the high will be brought down. MLK Jr was echoing this.
	* The power structures in society are demolished and inverted.
	* When you're used to being on top, justice feels like oppression (but it's not)
	* John the Baptist doesn't talk about the government's role in leveling the way. Instead, when asked what we should do, he said (Luke 3:11-14) If you have 2 shirts, give one to someone who has none - this is a good starting place.
* As followers of Jesus, we should be the first to pursue justice in our own lives.
	* Injustice is keeping stuff for our own comfort. We can lay down our rights and power for generosity.
* Why? Isaiah 40:5 - The Glory of the Lord will be revealed for people to see
