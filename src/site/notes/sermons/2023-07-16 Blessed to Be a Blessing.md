7/16/2023 - Sermon Notes [[94-bible/Genesis 12\|Genesis 12]] vv1-8 - Call of Abraham, 7th Sunday of Summertide

Scripture has 6 acts to resure & redeem the world:

* Creation
* Fall
* Israel (Genesis 12 - Malachi)
* Jesus
* Church - Acts -  Rev 20
* New Creation - Rev. 21-22

In Genesis 12, Abram is a random guy who God calls. God tells Abram to leave but not where to go. Calls Abram away from his family and established life, to an unknown destination.

* But (v2) the call comes with a promise.
* In fact the call is much more about God's blessings on Abram
* God is not a taker. He asks for our committment but loves to bless his people.
* God blesses Abran - Not so Abram will be blessed, but so he will be a blessing to others. This is God's redemptive plan.
* This paradigm extends to us as the church. We are blessed to be blessings to others. [[2 Corinthians 1\|2 Corinthians 1]] v4.

Abram did it. we don't know what his reaction was other them to obey.

How might we be a blessing to others in our community?
