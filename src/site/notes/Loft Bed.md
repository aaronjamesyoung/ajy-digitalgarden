## Materials

* **Legs**
    * (4) 2x6 @ 8'
    * (4) 2x4 @ 8'
* **Frame**
    * (2) 2x6 @ 12' - Cut 84" / 60"
    * (2) 2x2 @ 12' - Cut *~81"* / 60" (MEASURE)
* **Railing**
    * (1) 2x6 @ 12' - Cut 84" / 60"
    * (?) 2x4 @ ?' - Cut ?" chunks - spacers (PLAN)
    * Scrap 2x2 to fill empty corner
* **Slats**
    * (6) 1x6 @ 60" - More?
* **Ladder**
    * (?) 2x4 @ 66" (MEASURE) (PLAN)

* Ladder - ladder - spacer (12' - cut at 66")
* Ladder - spacer - spacer - spacer (10' - but get an 8'; I'll have scrap for the last spacer - cut at 66")
