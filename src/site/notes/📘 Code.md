I'm a front-end and JavaScript developer. If you want to get in touch, please [[Contact Me\|Contact Me]].

Here are my code notes and snippets. I've typically been reliant on the internet to reference and explain code snippets in the past. So, my goal moving forward is to keep explanatory notes in this area rather than simple snippets to copy/paste.
