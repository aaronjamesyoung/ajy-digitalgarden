My website is a digital garden. What does that mean?

> A collection of thoughts, ideas, highlights, annotations, quotes, summaries, and notes that are richer than a tweet, but lack the timestamped nature of a blog post or published essay. ([What are digital gardens? â€“ Chuck Grimmett](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/))

> A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.

> A digital garden is a collection of imperfect notes, essays, and ideas growing slowly over time. ([Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/))

### I write about what I'm thinking about

I am taking notes in my daily life, about subjects I'm interested in. This website is essentially a compilation of those notes which I deem OK to publish.

### Content is upgraded over time

Some of my notes are pretty rough bulleted lists of ideas. I cycically revisit various topics and refine or correct the notes over time.

This relieves much of the pressure I'd feel if I commited to a blog publishing schedule, but still allows me to frequently update the site.

### The content is reference material for me...

... which I also think may be useful for others.

### I'm not sure if I like the content structure

Am I organizing my thoughts and notes well? I don't know. It'll change over time. Maybe.
