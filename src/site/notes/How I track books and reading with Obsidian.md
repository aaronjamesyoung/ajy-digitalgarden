[[ðŸ“˜ Books\|ðŸ“˜ Books]]

I've been using Obsidian for all my notes for some time now, and I've fairly recently started tracking my book reading in Obsidian as well.

I never really got into Goodreads, and I used [BookWyrm](https://joinbookwyrm.com/) for some time, but I don't need the social features of those types of sites. However, if you are looking for a Goodreads replacement with social functionality, then either Bookwyrm or Hardcover are excellent choices. If you just want a personal reading log, Obsidian will work great.

I'm definitely not the first to figure out this kind of system and I've built it from many other sources, but hopefully it's helpful for me to compile my method here.

My system is somewhat unique in that it allows for rereads.

### Required Community plugins

* [Obsidian Book Search Plugin](https://github.com/anpigon/obsidian-book-search-plugin) - Insert a note for each book with metadata pre-populated from Google Books
* [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) - Visualize your notes

Install the above plugins, then let's do some setup.

### Doing some setup

**Configure the Book Search plugin**:

First, set a folder where all your book notes will live. Second, create a new note to serve as a template for when you are adding book notes to your vault. Here is my template:

```
---
title: "{{title}}"
author: {{author}}
series: 
seriesnumber: 
rating: 
readdates:
- started: 
  finished: 
shelf: toread
list: 
publisher: {{publisher}}
publish: {{publishDate}}
pages: {{totalPage}}
isbn: {{isbn10}} {{isbn13}}
cover: <%=book.coverUrl ? `https://books.google.com/books/publisher/content/images/frontcover/${[...book.coverUrl.split("&")[0].matchAll(/id.?(.*)/g)][0][1]}?fife=w600-h900&source=gbs_api` : ''%>
dateCreated: {{date}}
---

![cover|150]({{coverUrl}})

## {{title}}

### Description

{{description}}
```

A few notes on the template:

* `series`, `seriesnumber`, `rating`, `readdates`, `shelf`, and `list` properties are not populated by the plugin. After adding a book note, you'll need to update these yourself.
* For `shelf`, you can choose what you want to do. I set it to one of: `toread`, `reading`, `read`, or `stopped`.
* `list` is meant to be a freeform field; I use it to create a list of recommended books.
* `cover` has been updated from the default cover URL that the plugin provides. This version will give you large-format covers instead of small.
* For `rating`, I use a number (1-5). My dataview queries below convert these to star emojis.
* `readdates` is meant to accomodate multiple rereads. You would fill it out like this:

```
readdates:
- started: 2023-08-10
  finished: 2023-08-15
- started: 2023-09-05
  finished: 2023-09-12
```

... and so on. Unfortunately this doesn't play well with the Obsidian Properties UI that was released recently in 1.4, so you might want to switch to source view while editing these dates.

**Configure Dataview**

Make sure that DataviewJS queries are enabled.

### Start using it: Add a few books

* Run the Obsidian command "Book Search: Create new note" and search for a book.
* You'll see a list of book editions. Pick one. Probaby the first one.
* Obsidian will create a new note and show it to you. Update the series, seriesnumber, and any other relevant information in the properties.

### Visualize your books

OK, here's the dataview dump everyone's been asking for! I use separate notes in my vault for each of these queries:

**Bookshelf: to read**

    | Cover | Title | author | series |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |

{ .block-language-dataview}

* This displays the cover at 80px wide
* Title is a link to the book note
* Assumes that your book notes are stored in a folder called "books"
* Throughout these examples, double check your shelf names.

**Bookshelf: currently reading**

````
| Cover | Title | author | series |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |

{ .block-language-dataview}
````

**Bookshelf: stopped reading**

````
| Cover | Title | author | series |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |

{ .block-language-dataview}
````

When stopping a book, don't put a date in "finished" because it'll make your book display in this next query:

**Bookshelf: Read in 2023**

````
<div><table class="dataview table-view-table"><thead class="table-view-thead"><tr class="table-view-tr-header"><th class="table-view-th"><span></span><span class="dataview small-text">0</span></th><th class="table-view-th"><span></span></th><th class="table-view-th"><span></span></th><th class="table-view-th"><span></span></th><th class="table-view-th"><span></span></th><th class="table-view-th"><span></span></th></tr></thead><tbody class="table-view-tbody"></tbody></table><div class="dataview dataview-error-box"><p class="dataview dataview-error-message">Dataview: No results to show for table query.</p></div></div>
````

OK, here's where things get interesting. We're using DataviewJS to create a fancier query.

* The first function helps us render start/finished dates into more natural language than YYYY-MM-DD.
* Then we build a table.
* `dv.pages('"books"')` refers to the "books" folder where your book notes are kept.
* We filter alll the books by checking to see if the book was finished during 2023, and then sort the books by finished date.

**List the 5-star books from 2023**

````

{ .block-language-dataview}
````

**Show how many books you have read in 2023**

````

{ .block-language-dataview}
````

**Display covers of books grouped by series**

````

````

From all these examples, I hope you can build other queries you might want.

To extend this system, you can use the Air Quotes plugin to take notes and quote from your book. You'll need an ebook copy of your book, but this plugin makes it easy to find and insert quotes from your book.
