## What is Fastpacking?

Fastpacking is essentially overnight backpacking, but running. So I carry a lightweight pack with overnight gear, food, and water, and generally run the flats / downs, and hike the uphills. Here are various notes, articles, and resources I use when planning fastpacking trips or gear.

## Route recommendations in Central Oregon

Here are a few fastpacking rotes I'd recommend in Central Oregon. I've done all these routes.

* If you're a beginner, going out for the first time, I'd recommend a low-intensity single night trip. The [[Brokentop Circuit\|Brokentop Circuit]] is a 42-mile loop (with some additional miles from potential out and backs) around Brokentop with moderate hills, so it does require fitness.
* The [[Three Sisters Loop\|Three Sisters Loop]] is a popular loop that circumnavigates the Three Sisters in the Central Oregon Cascades. The loop itself is 44 miles, but there are no trailheads directly on the loop - you have to access the route from one of several side trails. Depending on your chosen trailhead, you can do this route in anywhere from 50 to 75 or more miles. Recommend 2 nights for most options.
* Don't want to purchase a permit for the Three Sisters Wilderness? Try the [[No-permit Three Sisters Wilderness Route\|No-permit Three Sisters Wilderness Route]]. I'm sure there are many more ways of accomplishing this. The route would take 3 days / 2 nights, is about 55 miles, and only requires a free self-issue day use permit to move through the wilderness on day 2.
* For a lesser known route, you can try the [[Heart of Darkness\|Heart of Darkness]] in the eastern Ochoco Mountains. You should be comfortable with wilderness navigation as the trails are faint, overgrown, and quite difficult to follow. You'll need a GPS track and you should have a satellite communicator / PLB device as there is no cell service in the area. The loop is 42 miles with some big hills and tricky footing.
