Here's a fun exercise.

I compiiled a list of all the wordle answers to date (through Wordle 918, on 2023-12-24) and found the frequency of each letter in the answers.

This isn't really an in-depth analysis. I don't account for letter order, repeated letters in words, and many other factors that probably could be helpful. Some of these are hard to quantiy - for example, Wordle doesn't often use plurals - but here's what I found:

- A: 413
- B: 110
- C: 193
- D: 147
- E: 486
- F: 82
- G: 130
- H: 169
- I: 255
- J: 10
- K: 91
- L: 272
- M: 123
- N: 221
- O: 323
- P: 143
- Q: 14
- R: 365
- S: 240
- T: 311
- U: 180
- V: 51
- W: 73
- X: 18
- Y: 151
- Z: 19

Thus, the top 10 letters used in Wordle answers are:

* E: 486
* A: 413
* R: 365
* O: 323
* T: 311
* L: 272
* I: 255
* S: 240
* N: 221
* C: 193

Therefore, I think a good starting word would be:

* LATER

After this guess, you should prioritize the letters:

* O
* I
* S
* N
* C

If the Wordle contains no letters from the word LATER, you should guess:

* SCION

I'll be trying this out to see if my scores improve.
