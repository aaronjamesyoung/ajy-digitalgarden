[[📘 Books\|📘 Books]]

A sampling of some good books or series, in no particular order (other than by title). If you ask me what you should read, I will send you this list.

I'm limiting this list to one book per author. This list includes some "first book of series" entries.

| Cover                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | title                                 | author             | series                                           |
