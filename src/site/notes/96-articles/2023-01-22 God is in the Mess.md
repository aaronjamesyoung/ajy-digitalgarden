[[94-bible/Psalm 27\|Psalm 27]]

* Lectionary has verses 1-9 for today. It keeps the passages short on purpose. But we'll cover the whole psalm today.
* Authentic prayer from a place of pain: "I'm not well and it is well"
* Praying the psalms is about allowing God to change us.

* v1 - Psalmist is proclaiming that "it is well" - head knowledge - but also a good thing to consciously remind us.
* vv 2-3 - acknowledgement and lament of hard situation, once again a reminder "my heart will not fear"
* vv 4-5 - God is our light and salvation, our stronghold.
    * In hard circumstances, we need to position ourselves in God's presence
