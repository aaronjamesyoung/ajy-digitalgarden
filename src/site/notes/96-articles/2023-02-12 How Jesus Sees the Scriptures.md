[[94-bible/Psalm 119\|Psalm 119]] verses 1-8

* Psalm 119 is an acrostic psalm. 8 verses start with each letter of the Hebrew alphpabet. Focuses on the Scriptures. Each verse has 1 or more references to the word of God:
    * Commands, Decrees, laws, precepts, promises, statutes, ways, words
    * Let's be honest. Most of us don't generally feel this passionate about scripture, at least not enough to write a 176 verse poem about it. We probably don't feel quite that passionate about anything!

* Why are we, as american Christians today, so awkward with scripturer ? Three observations:
    * We don't read it enough
    * We don't know how to read scripture
    * When we do read it, we don't like it

* So , what did Jesus believe about the Bible?
    * The Bible is a story - [[94-bible/John 5\|John 5]] vv 37-40
        * Jesus didn't primarily see the Bible as a comprehensive instruction manual, but rather as a story pointing to himself
    * The Bible is inspired [[94-bible/Matthew 5\|Matthew 5]] vv 17-18
    * The Bible is authoritative [[94-bible/John 10\|John 10]] 34-36
    * The Bible is human and divine: Scripture and literature.
        * Inspired and authoritative, the word of God: [[94-bible/2 Timothy 3\|2 Timothy 3]] 16-17
        * Written by people in a place and context: [[94-bible/1 Corinthians 1\|1 Corinthians 1]] 13-16
    * The Bible needs to be interpreted [[94-bible/Matthew 5\|Matthew 5]] 43-45
        * Hermeneutics: the study of interpreting scripture
            * Revelation: What does the Bible say?
            * Interpretation: What does it mean? This is not always the same as the words on the page may indicate. Immediate context, scriptural context, and other factors affect interpretation. Scripture, badly interpreted, has been used to justify horrific acts.
            * Application: What does it mean for us?

* Psalm 119 is not a work of self-expression. In a sense, it's not really about being passionate enough about scripture to write 176 verses. It's liturgical. We should pray this psalm as a means of formation.
