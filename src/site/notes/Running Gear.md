[[📘 Running\|📘 Running]]

Here's pretty much anything I may take out on a run. Let's start with stuff I wear - from the feet up - and then get to gear and accessories.

## Shoes

* **Brooks Divide 3** - new to me as of 2022-11-12. I've been having some ankle pain on the left side - not due to bad shoes but because I have some muscle issues I think - but these should be helpful moving forward. Maybe?
* **Hoka Torrent 2** - I've been through many pairs of these and generally get around 500 miles on them. I'm keeping my last pair for this winter - I got them screwed at the local running store for snow running.

## Socks

* **Injinji toe socks** - I like these for long days but they sure don't last
* Normal non-toe running socks

## Pants

* Nothing special - typical running pants. Not tights although I have one pair for layering on extra cold days.
* [[MYOG Wind Pants\|MYOG Wind Pants]]

## Shorts

* Nothing special - typical running shorts with a liner.

## Shirts

* **Mountain Hardware Crater Lake sun hoody** - this is my go-to running shirt. It ventilates really well for hot summer mountain days but is also comfy under a wind shell in cooler weather. UPF 50 sun protection, long sleeves and a hood.
* Other various long-sleeved technical running shirts - I don't wear short sleeves running.

## Jackets & Shells

## Hats

* **Outdoor Research Swift cap** - This is comfortable but too hot on hot sunny days. Consider modifying to make it cooler or get a different UPF 50 running cap.
* Random REI cap from a few years ago - has a floppy brim and is nice and cool & comfy
* New Balance beanie

## Pack

* [[MYOG Trail Running Pack\|MYOG Trail Running Pack]]
* Anything inside that needs to stay dry goes into a gallon ziploc

## Other Gear

* **Goodr Sunglasses** - If the question is running sunglasses, the answer is Goodr.
* **Garmin Forerunner 245** - No music
* **Biolite 330 Headlamp** - I like this - it's comfortable and plenty bright - but the battery life has decreased over time, and the red light went out.
* **Aonijie 500ml soft water flasks** - I carry two of these on my pack. I don't like water bladders. Would prefer wide-mouth or flip-top flasks (also would like compatibility with Salomon XA filter)
* **Katadyn BeFree filter + Hydrapak Seeker 2L reservoir** - For long days I carry a filter and compatible reservoir in the stretchy back pocket of my pack.
* [[First Aid Kit\|First Aid Kit]]
* **Garmin Inreach Mini** - first generation
* Other random stuff - Phone, TP & wipes, etc.
