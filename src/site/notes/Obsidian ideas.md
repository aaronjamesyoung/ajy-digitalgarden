The most meta file in the vault. Link this to something or delete it. I dunno.

What can I do with Obsidian as a daily planner and logger as well as resource archive?

* Local REST API plugin
* Webhooks plugin

(above plugins may not be necessary if I use node-red and some logic with files)

A lot of the ideas below involve finding new stuff to track. But really I want better ways to work with existing data.

## Ideas

* Weather in daily notes
* Piano practice log
    * Note that this may be separate from daily? Does it feel weird to have two journals?
* Running log, sync from Strava
    * keep stats
    * Keep heatmaps by month or something?
* Health log and stats
    * nutrition: Myfitnesspal, has api?
* Book tracking
    * Can I get back into my seatable database and recover anything? I dunno
* OCR
* Location tracking for important stuff
* Daily log with timestamps [My Obsidian Daily Note Template 2022 | Michelle Mac](https://heymichellemac.com/obsidian-daily-note-2022#-daily-log)
* Photo journaling [Sharing Path - Apps - App Store - Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/sharingpath)

## Organization

Types of notes I'm seeing so far:

* Reference / Archival
* Projects
* Dated notes
* "collection" notes

How do these map to bujo notes?

Bullet journal:

* Daily / Weekly / Monthly
* Collections

I don't know that I want two levels. I also don't know that I want tagging....
