I'm a trail runner - nearly all of my running is on trails and gravel/dirt forest roads. I'm lucky to live in a spot where I can hit the forest from my front door.

I currently don't race much - instead I focus on preparing for solo adventures like [[ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking\|ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking]] or personal challenges like the [[Newberry 50 - Running 50 buttes south of Bend\|Newberry 50 - Running 50 buttes south of Bend]].

I've run a few ultramarathons and I ran cross country and track all through high school and college.
