Ideas for a diy couch

Also, watch Habitat and local thrift shops

## Inspiration

* [Zig Zag Sofa](http://www.homemade-modern.com/ep108-zig-zag-sofa/) But without the stupid desk attachment
    * Might prefer more farmhouse style to go with table
* [Site Unreachable](http://www.ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/storage-sofa)

## Cushions

        * Seat: 5-10 degree angle
        * Backrest: 100-110 degrees
