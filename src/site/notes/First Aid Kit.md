I started with the Adventure Medical Kits 0.3 kit (their smallest one). I've removed a few things and added others. My kit weighs roughly 3 oz, and I keep it in a red ziploc bag.

* Alcohol pads - 4 sterile prep pads
* Aquatabs - one strip in case of filter failure
* Bandaids - a few various sizes. Handy for blisters
* Benadryl - antihistimine. Include usage instructions
* Forceps - ticks, other uses
* Gauze - small roll
* Gloves - 1 pair medical gloves
* Ibuprofen - some in small ziploc. Include usage instructions
* N95 mask - for smoke
* Large Safety pin
* athletic tape
