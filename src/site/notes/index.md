## Hello!

I'm a trail runner and JavaScript developer located in Bend, Oregon.

This is my website. It's a sort of digital garden - a spot where I share my thinking and how it grows and evolves over time.

Here's some stuff you can do:

* Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/aaronjamesyoung) to see my running adventures
* Get in touch about working on a web development project. I work with Vue, Node, and WordPress. Please check my [[Résumé\|Résumé]] and [[Contact Me\|Contact Me]] if you’re interested in working together.
* Find out more [[About Me\|About Me]]
* Read this site to see what I'm working on and thinking about. I suggest starting at the links below.
