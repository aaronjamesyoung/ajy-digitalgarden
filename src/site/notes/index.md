## Hello!

**I'm a trail runner and JavaScript developer located in Bend, Oregon.** I work with Vue, Node, and WordPress. Find out more [[About Me\|About Me]]. Please check myÂ [[RÃ©sumÃ©\|RÃ©sumÃ©]] and [[Contact Me\|Contact Me]] if youâ€™re interested in working together.

**What is this site?** It's my [[Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]]. In short, it's an evolving and expanding set of notes I try to keep about everything I do. Find out [[How this site is built\|How this site is built]].

**Outdoors,** I spend a lot of time [[ðŸ“˜ Running\|ðŸ“˜ Running]] on trails and [[ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking\|ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking]] when I can. I also [[ðŸ“˜ MYOG\|ðŸ“˜ MYOG]] ("Make your own gear") a lot of the items I use. **Want to track my running?** Follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1057219).

**I work as a web developer**, so I'm working on expanding my notes on [[ðŸ“˜ Code and Work\|ðŸ“˜ Code and Work]].

**I also keep notes about** [[ðŸ“˜ Life\|ðŸ“˜ Life]] and the [[ðŸ“˜ News Articles\|ðŸ“˜ News Articles]] I find important. **You can follow me** on [BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.ajy.co/user/aaronjamesyoung) to track the books I've been reading. (If you're on Mastodon or another Fediverse network, you can follow my BookWyrm account from there.)
