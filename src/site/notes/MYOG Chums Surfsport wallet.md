[[ðŸ“˜ MYOG\|ðŸ“˜ MYOG]]

This does not include the vinyl window. Seam allowance will be 1/4"

Needed:

* 1 foot #3 zipper
* Two zipper pulls
* 9.5" of 3/4" nylon webbing
* 5" of grosgrain
* Inner fabric
* Outer fabric

Cuts:

* 3 Outer fabric pieces, 5" x 2 3/4". The first two are the outer pieces and will each have a zipper attached to one edge. The third is the outer pocket, and will have a rolled hem on one side, then will be attached to the zipper along with the back outer piece.
* 2 Inner fabric pieces, 5" x 3 1/2". The first is an inner divider between the two pockets. The second will be hemmed along the top and will be an internal divider in the front pocket.
* The 9.5" webbing is for the key loop. The Chums wallet uses grosgrain for this, but mine wore out so I used webbing instead when making my own.
* The 5" grosgrain is to bind the top internal raw edge after sewing.

Prep:

* Outer front (this is where the vinyl window is on the Chums wallet):
	* Place this piece on your table right side up, and align the zipper wrong side up along the top 5" edge. Sew zipper on with 1/4" seam allowance, flip the zipper up, and top-stitch to finish the zipper. Including the zipper, the front will now be 5" x 3 1/2".
	* Add zipper pull
* Outer Pocket:
	* Sew a double-rolled 1/2" hem along one 3 1/2" side
* Outer back:
	* Place this piece on your table right side up
	* Place the Outer Pocket on top of it, right side up, aligned to one side
	* Fold 10" webbing in half (add hardware if you want), and place all the way in pocket so it is aligned to opposite edge at back of pocket
	* Baste stitch the outer pocket to outer back, catch webbing loop along back of pocket
	* Place the zipper on top of both of these, wrong side up, sew with 1/4" seam allowance, flip the zipper up, and top stitch to finish the zipper. The back piece will now be 5" x 3 1/2", and will have the pocket attached.
	* Add zipper pull
* Internal pocket divider:
	* Do a 3/8" rolled hem along one long side

Layout: Place your pieces on the table in this order, starting from bottom:

1. Inner full divider (not the hemmed internal pocket piece). The 5" edges are the top and bottom
2. On top of this, place your internal pocket divider piece, right side up, aligned at top edge, and with hem on the bottom.
3. Next layer is outer front, right side up, zipper at bottom, aligned on all four edges
4. Finally, outer pocket + back, wrong side up, zipper at top, aligned on all four edges

Sewing:

* Sew all the way around with 1/4" seam allowance. At each zipper end, sew over, reverse, and sew over again.
* Use grosgrain to bind the top raw edge
* Turn right side out through the zipper opening
