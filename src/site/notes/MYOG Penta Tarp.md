## Thoughts

* Build traditional penta tarp w/out doors
* Add perimeter bug netting
* On front, this should be one solid sheet of netting w/out door flaps. Include a kam snap + grosgrain attachment at bottom center which can loop around pole at the ground, or snap to the tarp when up
* Keep cutouts for maybe turning into doors which can be installed w/ kam snaps. Perhaps sew them together as a type of "batwing" that can also be attached at bottom of trekking pole

## Measurements

Need to build this out of paper first to verify measurements or see if coverage is what I'm hoping for
