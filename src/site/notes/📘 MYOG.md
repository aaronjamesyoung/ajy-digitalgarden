* [[01-personal/MYOG Fleece Pullover\|MYOG Fleece Pullover]]
* [[01-personal/MYOG Quilt\|MYOG Quilt]]
* [[01-personal/MYOG Square Tarp and Net Tent\|MYOG Square Tarp and Net Tent]]
* [[01-personal/MYOG Trail Running Pack\|MYOG Trail Running Pack]]
* [[01-personal/MYOG Wind Pants\|MYOG Wind Pants]]

as well as a handful of stuff sacks and miscellaneous items.

Todo add to this note: sewing notes, techniques, resources, etc.
