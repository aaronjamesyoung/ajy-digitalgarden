"ForÂ in him all theÂ fullness of God was pleased to dwell,Â andÂ through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven,Â making peaceÂ by the blood of his cross." - Colossians 1:19-20

What is God reconciling? All things. We can break down the relationships into the following categories. I'll work on connecting in notes over time.

## God

    * We confess our communal sin using "we" language; even if we haven't personally participated, we are involved in unjust systems and patterns that are bigger than ourselves [[94 - Bible/Daniel 9\|Daniel 9]]

## Others - City

## Others - World
