The process of booking a Central Cascades Wilderness Permit is as easy as an online checkout. But determining whether and when to get one can be complicated, so I hope this helps simplify the requirements.

This information is current as of 2023-02-01.

## Step 1: When are you going?

If you're going into the wilderness **between mid-June and mid-October** you may need to pre-purchase a permit. Outside these dates, no permits are required in the wilderness areas. Usually, the snowpack will limit you to low-elevation, sunny areas before June 15. You can access the wilderness after October 15 in most years, but weather can be dicey and unpredictable.

## Step 2: General information

* All permits are good for a group of up to 12 people. Each person should carry a copy of the permit and enter the wilderness together with the group.
* Overnight permits cost $6 (per trip, per group). 1-night solo trip? $6. 5-night trip with a group of 4? $6.
* Day use permits cost $1 (per group).
* Purchase a permit for the trailhead where you will enter the wilderness.

## Step 3: What type of trip are you taking?

### Overnight trips

A permit is required for all overnight stays within the wilderness area during permit season.

* Consult the [Three Sisters Wilderness Permit Map (PDF)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd899716.pdf) to decide which trailhead you want to use to enter the wilderness, and to identify one or two backup options.
* **In April (exact date & time TBA)**, Recreation.gov will release **40%** of the available permits for the whole season in advance. You can book up to 5 permits at this time, if you're quick enough.
    * This means you should be ready to refresh the webpage at 7am, and book your permits as quickly as possible.
* **7 days before the start of your trip**, the remaining **60%** of the permits (for your start day) will be released at 7:00 a.m. Pacific time. Again, it's a good idea to be quick to reserve these for popular trailheads.
    * Outside of the most popular trailheads, I have not had too much trouble booking permits. It does depend on the time of season and time of week.

### Day hikes

**Some trailheads** require pre-purchased permits for entry into the wilderness. Other trailheads allow you to get a free, self-issued permit from a kiosk at the trailhead, and these permits aren't limited in number.

* Consult the [Three Sisters Wilderness Permit Map (PDF)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd899716.pdf) to decide which trailhead you want to use to enter the wilderness, and to identify one or two backup options.
    * You only need to pre-purchase a permit for trailheads marked red.
    * If possible, I recommend planning your day so you enter the wilderness at a blue trailhead. It makes the process much easier. Simply arrive at the trailhead, fill out a paper permit, and go on your way.
* **In April (exact date & time TBA)**, Recreation.gov will release **40%** of the available permits for the whole season in advance. You can book up to 5 permits at this time, if you're quick enough.
    * This means you should be ready to refresh the webpage at 7am, and book your permits as quickly as possible.
* **10 days before the start of your trip**, some of the remaining **60%** of the permits (for your start day) will be released at 7:00 a.m. Pacific time. Again, it's a good idea to be quick to reserve these for popular trailheads.
* **2 days before the start of your trip**, the rest of the permits (for your start day) will be released at 7:00 a.m. Pacific time. Again, it's a good idea to be quick to reserve these for popular trailheads.
    * Outside of the most popular trailheads, I have not had too much trouble booking permits. It does depend on the time of season and time of week.

## Step 4: Plan your trip

Some tips to make it easier to get permits:

* Plan to get mid-week permits if possible
* Plan a few different trailheads where you can enter the wilderness
* For day use - can you use a non-permit trailhead to get where you want to go?
* For overnight use - can you camp outside the wilderness and pass through it in a single day from a non-permit trailhead?

As a runner who's not afraid of some extra miles, I can approach the permit process with flexibility.

## Step 5: Purchase a permit

* Identify when you will be able to purchase a permit for your start date.
* Ahead of time, create an account on Recreation.gov and be logged in, so you will be ready.
* At precisely 7:00 a.m. Pacific time, be ready to refresh the Recreation.gov page and add your permit to your cart. You then havev a 15 minute grace period to make the purchase.

## Is it always this bad?

Not really. Getting a permit isn't always this cutthroat - I'm describing the most extreme situation - but it pays to plan ahead and act quickly.

* Popular trailheads require quicker action
* July is the most popular month. It's much easier to get a permit in September.
* Weekends are most popular. It's easier to book mid-week permits.

**Can't make your trip?** Log in and cancel your permit to free it up for someone else.

**Couldn't get a permit or plan a workaround?** As the trip date approaches, keep checking back to see if someone has given up a permit.
