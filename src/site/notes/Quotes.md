TODO break these apart and put in book notes.

## Self

* Work the work. Plan the plan.
* What? Huh?
* Woop wop
* Put some pepper in your step

## Books of Babel

Several of these are from epigraphs from in-world books, specifically *I sip a cup of wind* by Jumet

* The mob does two things well: nothing and revolution.
* A man may rot like an egg: His shell does not show it, but all that is within him has gone foul.
* The inability to compromise isn’t a sign of moral rectitude — it’s a sign of immaturity. You know who can’t be bargained with? Little children and madmen.
* A man who is not suspicious of a philosophy that appeals to his nature is like the bull comforted by the rutted path that leads to the slaughterhouse.
* A half-hearted apology is as good as a half-struck match.
* Do not waste the limited resource of your patience on those who think misery a competition. Spendthrifts of self-pity are always miserly the moment empathy is due.
* The human race will march into the darkness singing songs and telling stories because that is who we are and what we do.
* True conspiracies are inflexible and susceptible to discovery, but imaginary plots are ever evolving and, as a result, invulnerable. That is to say, conspiracies are perishable, paranoia is not.
* The ground is full of self-righteous bones, but we would do well to remember it is the cause, not the loss, that ennobles sacrifice.
* Do not race your postcards home. Dally long enough for word of your adventures to arrive before you. Let them announce you and lay the foundation for your legend.
* Don’t saw off your arm to feed a dog. You only have two arms, and the world is full of dogs.
* At the round table of color, orange sits supreme. Orange is sublime. Orange is ablaze. And seated across from Lady Orange, we have Sir Purple. I ask you, is any color more vulgar? The word alone emerges like something from a lavatory. Purple. Plopple. It’s all prunes, liver spots, and ink stains. If I ever utter a word of praise for that wretched hue, please snatch my pen away and gore me with it.
* If you lie loud and long enough, it eventually becomes the truth.
* Learning starts with failure.
* An earnest failure is superior to immaculate potential.
* Often the simplest way to unlock a door is to knock upon it.
* But the human race came into the world with all the physical prowess of a custard
* We have spent our lives scrabbling up the mountainside without the promise of a mountaintop.
* Long dies the revolution!

## East of Eden

* And still the box is not full.

## Lord of the Rings

* who are you, yourself, alone and nameless?
