## Definitions

What is Christian nonviolence?

* Definitions and preferred positions can vary from one Christian to another.
* Rejection of lethal violence as a tool to resist or control others.
* Employ nonviolent resistance methods against enemies
    * Spiritual (Love your enemies and pray for them)
    * Verbal
    * Physical (non-lethal physical resistance - i.e., body-check someone)
* Nonviolent resistance is often effective - but prioritize faithfulness over effectiveness. Act rightly - nonviolently - and trust God to work the situation to the best.

## Recommended Reading

* *Nonviolence - The Revolultionary Way of Jesus* - Preston Sprinkle
    * Earlier edition titled *Fight - A Christian case for nonviolence*
    * This is a good introductory defense of Christian nonviolence for Christians who are beginning to research this for themselves. I think the author overemphasizes his conservative "credentials" in places, but he knows his audience. If you are just starting to think about this, start here.
    * This book walks through the Old Testament, New Testament, and early church history to promote a Christian view of nonviolence
    * [[booknotes/Book Notes - Nonviolence, the Revolutionary Way of Jesus\|Book Notes - Nonviolence, the Revolutionary Way of Jesus]]
* *Jesus and Nonviolence - A Third Way* - Walter Wink
    * In this book, the focus is on presenting nonviolent resistance as an alternative to either violence, or passive non-resistance.
* *The Myth of a Christian Nation* - Greg Boyd
    * This book is not specifically about nonviolence, but addresses some issues, misconceptions, and objections that are raised against Christian nonviolence.
    * The book states that because the Kingdom of God is different from kingdoms of this world, no nation-state can really claim to be a "Christian" nation - and doing so hurts the witness of Christians both within and without the country.
