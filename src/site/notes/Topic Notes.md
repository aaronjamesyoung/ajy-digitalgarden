As I take notes about various things, sometimes certain topics emerge. I create "topic" notes to handle these. Topic notes are designated with a notebook emoji 📘

Ideally, my topic notes contain:

* a description of the topic and how it's important to me
* Links to all notes mentioning the topic
* External articles that I've been reading about the topic

Different topics tend to organize themselves differently. So they aren't all structured exactly the same.

Over time I may add various topics. I may also remove them or demote them to regular notes.
