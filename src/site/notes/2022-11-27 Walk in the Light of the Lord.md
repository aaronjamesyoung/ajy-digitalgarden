[[94 - Bible/Isaiah 2\|Isaiah 2]] v1-5

* First Sunday of Advent: the Incarnation
    * [[94 - Bible/John 1\|John 1]]
    * God has precedent for meeting us here on Earth - wrestling w/ Jacob, Joshua & Jericho, Meeting Abraham and Sarah, Moses on Sinai & the burning bush.
    * But the incarnation is different.
* Platonic dualism -> gnosticism -> docetism - essentially, the material world is evil or inferior to a conceptual world of spirituality, ideas, or knowledge. They would claim that God therefore could not have become material.
    * These seem like ancient heresies, but they have echoes in our lives today:
        * Do we believe our Sunday mornings and spiritual disicplines are more sacred than our daily lives?
        * Do we define our salvation as an "escape" from a world in Satan's hands?
        * Do we view the world as only fallen and hopeless?
    * As Christians we can disproportionally focus on the relationship between God and our soul as an attempt to escape or disembody ourselves.
        * [[94 - Bible/Genesis 2\|Genesis 2]] v7 - We should not inappropriately separate body and soul - soul is the whole creature
* Jesus became flesh to show us what God's originally intended life is like: Including dependence on others, love through relational fellowship, OK to be sad or joyful or despairing
    * Life itself is a gift from God
    * We should see how we are loved by God and love ourselves as He loves us
    * Remember the holiness of everyday life.
