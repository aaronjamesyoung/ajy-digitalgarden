Todo - pics and writeup

* 12oz. This was about as light as I could make a 2-person net tent.
* When I say 2-person, I mean two people on pretty good terms.
    * Floor has room for 2 pads but it tapers to the foot end.
* I only bring this during bug season, pitch the tarp in A-frame over it
* Silpoly floor (matches [[MYOG Square Tarp\|MYOG Square Tarp]]) and 0.67oz bug netting
