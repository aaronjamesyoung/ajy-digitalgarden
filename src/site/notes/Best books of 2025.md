I usually keep three books going at once: A classic, a modern fiction, and a fantasy / science fiction. I also had a few nonfiction books this year. However, early in the year I had some personal stress and settled into mostly easy fantasy and science fiction books and a good dose of rereads.

Below are my favorite reads in each of these different categories for this year, excluding rereads:

## Classics

* **The Canterbury Tales** (Geoffrey Chaucer) - I enjoyed most of this, including the humor. [The edition available on Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/geoffrey-chaucer/the-canterbury-tales) uses mostly modern spellings and includes great footnotes that made this easier to read.
* **Demons** (Fyodor Dostoyevsky) - The discussion of nihilism and the outworkings of this philosophy is very relevant in 2025.

## Modern Fiction

* **The Bean Trees** (Barbara Kingsolver) - A young woman moves out west. This was great.

## Fantasy

* **House of Open Wounds** (Adrian Tchaikovsky) - This is book 2 of the Tyrant Philosophers series. It's kind of fantasy MASH with some really serious moments based in a military field hospital.
* **The Strength of the Few** (James Islington) - Also a book 2. The Will of the Many was a banger and this one is just about as good. Fun and action packed.
* Let's give an honorable mention to The Wizard Knight duology by Gene Wolfe for a book that was dense and intricate. You won't catch everything the first time through.

## Science Fiction

* **Anathem** (Neal Stephenson) - Most people like Snow Crash better (I absolutely did not) but I had a lot of fun with this. While the ending wasn't my favorite, the rest was great.

Bring on 2026, I'm looking forward to seeing what I can find out there.
