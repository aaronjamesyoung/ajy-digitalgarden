[[ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking\|ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking]]

Stuff that might go with me on a backpacking or fastpacking trip. This is my gear, not a list of recommended gear to purchase. However this list would be a good place to start a checklist of gear needed.

See specifics: [Gear Spreadsheet](https://docs.getgrist.com/7Q4c8BfaPihH/Gear-List)

## Pack

* [[MYOG Fastpack\|MYOG Fastpack]]
