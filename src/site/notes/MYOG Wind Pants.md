These are my super lame wind pants, made [[2022-11-19\|2022-11-19]]. They are pretty roomy so I can pull them on over a pair of sweats if needed.

They have pockets, a shock cord drawcord at the waist, and rolled hems at the ankles. I was considering to add snap plackets on the ankles, but chose not to. I may end up opening the side seams at the ankles to add snap plackets someday, but I'll try it as-is for now.

If I add a snap placket, I would use this technique: [Henley Shirt Placket tutorial - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bVtTBWDpM8) and enclose some 3/4" grosgrain inside the snap placket for better reinforcement for the snaps. 

The biggest challenge was sizing + pattern. I started with the [Paco pants](https://freesewing.org/designs/paco/) pattern but needed to make several adjustments, since I'm not using a separate waistband or cuffs. It took a failed attempt in order to get it right, and my final project still is a bit awkwardly shaped. It might be better if you have a different pair of pants you can cut up to pattern these after, or if you can start off with some really cheap fabric to make a prototype and adjust sizing based on that.

The pants weigh 2.3 ounces and are made of [1.1oz uncalendered ripstop nylon](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/1-1-oz-ripstop-nylon?variant=43872843268266) from Ripstop By The Roll. The pocket liners are made from [Monolite Mesh](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/breathable-nylon-fabric/products/1-0-oz-monolite-ripstop-nylon-mesh?variant=43872818593962). This was a cheap and fairly easy project.
