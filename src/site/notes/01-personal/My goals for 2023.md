## Running

I'm currently in a bit of a running slump. My ankle has been bugging me and the weather has been bad (which results in snowy or slushy conditions near my house).

* **A Goal** - Run a 100-mile race
* **B Goal** - Run 2,000 miles this year
* **C Goal** - Keep myself healthy and able to run consistently

You can track my running on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/aaronjamesyoung)

## Reading

* Read 24 books this year (2 per month)

You can track my reading on [BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.ajy.co/user/aaronjamesyoung)

## Writing

* (non-quantitative) - Better organize my notes
* (offline) Establish daily habit of bullet journaling
* Publish 100 new notes in 2023 to this site

I'm not going to stress about them being high-quality notes. In fact probably 40-50 of them will be weekly sermon notes from church, which I don't bother refining too much as I doubt there is much of an audience for them.
