[[ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking\|ðŸ“˜ Fastpacking]]

On a fastpacking trip, daily mileage and pacing can depend on a number of factors:

* terrain
* topography
* temperature and weather
* logistics and schedule
* water sources

I generally aim for around 25- to 30-mile days in ideal conditions. I move fairly slowly because of the pack, and I try to keep it in "Type 1 fun" territory at all times by not pushing myself too hard.

If I go too hard, I find myself developing symptoms such as:

* blisters
* fatigue
* overheating
* nausea
* being generally miserable

I sometimes pace myself around 4 miles/hour, including breaks, but I try not to move any faster than this and am often slower.
