"The ends justify the means"

Nope!

Good ends do not justify bad means. Instead, bad means corrupt the good ends. Tolkien wrote about this in *Lord of the Rings*, when Saruman tells Gandalf:

> The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world of Men, which we must rule. But we must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise can see... A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Númenor. This then is one choice before you. before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it. As the Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. There need not be, there would not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means.

Of course, Gandalf recognizes what is happening and refuses.

Closer to home, this has political implications. From a recent Washington Post article [Donald Trump would act ‘like a little elementary school child,’ former spiritual adviser James Robison says - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/17/trump-spiritual-adviser-criticism-child/):

> “All of us knew that Trump had character flaws, but we considered our relationship with him transactional,” wrote Evans, a Texas author and Christian Zionist who raises money for outreach and support in Israel. “We wanted Supreme Court justices to overturn *Roe v. Wade.* We wanted his support of our biblical values. We all wanted his support for the State of Israel. Donald Trump indeed kept and exceeded his promises to us.”
> 
> However, Evans said Trump had done damage by turning “the pulpit that we preach from” into a political platform.
> 
> “Donald Trump can’t save America. He can’t even save himself. He used us to win the White House. We had to close our mouths and eyes when he said things that horrified us,” Evans wrote. “I cannot do that anymore.”

As an aside from my main point, I'm obviously not a Trump supporter but I should note that viewing a relationship as transactional is a dehumanizing and selfish way to see another person.

It's not like these Christians were unaware that Trump would say and do awful things that would damage their witness. It's not like we couldn't tell that Trump was going to politicize the pulpit. It was obvious that Trump would do more damage than good. People were blinded by the desire for political power and gain.

I believe it's never OK to do something bad in order to achieve something good. As I stated above, bad means corrupt good ends. We have to be willing to maintain our integrity by forgoing shortcuts to our good ends.
