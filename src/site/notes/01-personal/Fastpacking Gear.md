[[📘 Fastpacking\|📘 Fastpacking]]

Stuff that might go with me on a backpacking or fastpacking trip. This is my gear, not a list of recommended gear to purchase. However this list would be a good place to start a checklist of gear needed.

## Pack

* [[01-personal/MYOG Fastpack\|MYOG Fastpack]]
* Anything that needs to stay dry will go in a garbage bag

## Shelter

* [[01-personal/MYOG Square Tarp and Net Tent\|MYOG Square Tarp and Net Tent]] (the net tent only is packed during bug season)

## Sleep

* [[01-personal/MYOG Quilt\|MYOG Quilt]] - 22 oz

* 1/8" foam pad - when layered on top of the folding pad, it's a pretty comfortable combination. It helps to have a campsite with soft ground.
