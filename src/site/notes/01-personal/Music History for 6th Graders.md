## What is this?

These are my notes for teaching a broad outline of Western music history to my daughter. I expect this to take around 7 or 8 sessions, with a few of the lessons below spread over 2 sessions.

### Why?

This is intended to give her some context when playing different classical-tradition pieces. If she plays a piece by 
Bach or Brahms, she should have a basic understanding of which came first and how they relate to one another.

### Learning Objectives

* Place major classical music eras on a timeline
* Place prominent composers on a timeline and classify them as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, or Modern composers based on their dates
* Verbalize key differences between the major classical music eras and their approximate dates
* Understand that stylistic changes didn't happen overnight and some composers may straddle eras
* Classify a piece she is playing as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, or Modern based on stylistic cues as well as composer's dates

### Background

My daughter:

* Has been playing piano for a couple years now
* Has some experience playing classical-tradition pieces
* Is also in school orchestra playing viola

I:

* have music teaching experience (band)
* have been teaching my daughter piano
* have a mostly classical-tradition background

## Lessons

1. Medieval and Renaissance periods: the roots of tonality
2. Baroque period: Complexity, ornamentation, and Bach
3. Classical period: Simplicity, tonality, Mozart, Beethoven as intro to Romantic
