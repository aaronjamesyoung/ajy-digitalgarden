I made an ultralight windshell jacket! Here's an extremely high-quality picture of it:

* Pattern: [Learn MYOG UL Windshell](https://learnmyog.com/windshell.html)
* Material: [1.1 oz Ripstop Nylon](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/breathable-nylon-fabric/products/1-1-oz-ripstop-nylon?variant=43872843268266). The blue fabric is calendared, gray is uncalendared and therefore more breatheable. I was planning to do it in all gray, but I didn't have quite enough.
* Weight: 3.2 oz

The pattern was mostly easy to follow and sew. Sizing is accurate but I think I could use a half size bigger. I'm going to do a rain shell next, and I think I'll size it up a full size (for wearing over layers) and add a little length to the body.

I didn't add a cord cinch to the hood, and I think that is fine. It fits fairly snugly.

It's light, packs into a pocket, and is pretty comfy. So I'm happy.
