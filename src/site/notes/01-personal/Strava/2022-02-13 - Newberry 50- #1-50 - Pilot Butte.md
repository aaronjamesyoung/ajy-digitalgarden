Newberry 50: 50 peaks on the north side of Newberry Crater, mostly cinder cones. All the named peaks with >100 feet prominence, plus the unnamed peaks with >200 feet prominence. Caltopo link: https://caltopo.com/m/T00L5

This spring and summer I'm planning to summit all 50 of these buttes. I've set up some constraints so I'm doing exactly 50 from Bend, up to the crater rim. There are some other buttes that are smaller or "out of range" that I'll be skipping. There'll be a fair amount of off-trail navigating and summit bushwacks. I'll also be trying to get a summit photo of each one. Should be fun!
