[North Fork / Met-Win / Bridge Creek](https://www.strava.com/activities/7458699284)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |

| 13.14    | 2:00:45 | 2:07:57      | 9:11 | 2036      |


Fairly slow trails (plus I was running slowly). Deadfall and still some good snow in the upper sections. Give it a few more days to melt. This is such a sweet loop.
