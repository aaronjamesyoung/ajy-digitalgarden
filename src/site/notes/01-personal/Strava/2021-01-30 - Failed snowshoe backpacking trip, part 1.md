[Failed snowshoe backpacking trip, part 1](https://www.strava.com/activities/4708486479)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 5.72     | 2:09:24 | 2:50:55      | 22:38 | 1013      |


I got to a bridge that I was afraid to cross. There's a metaphor for life in there somewhere. Instead of completing the loop, I turned around and headed back downhill toward Tumalo Falls to find another way to my campsite.

I was breaking trail for a good chunk of the upper portion of this and it was very slow going.
