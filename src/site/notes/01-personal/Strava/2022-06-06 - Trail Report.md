[Trail Report](https://www.strava.com/activities/7267417884)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 9.98     | 1:31:32 | 1:37:34      | 9:10 | 1542      |


N Fork: Mostly-constant snow starts just over 2 miles up, a bit short of the Middle Fork log bridge. A couple weeks before clear to Happy Valley?

Bridge Creek: Clear up past the swampy cutoff junction, but the trail is seasonally flooded in the flat marshy area

S Fork: Mostly clear though the switchbacks. Some bigger patches of snow where I turned around, but there may be a bit more trail there. Some large blowdowns.
