[Backpacking Day 1 - to Green Lakes](https://www.strava.com/activities/5665845122)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 18.07    | 5:35:04 | 6:35:04      | 18:32 | 2675      |


From my house I hiked to Tumalo Falls, through the mosquito gauntlet that is Bridge Creek, up to Green Lakes, and found an empty campsite.

The Central Cascades wilderness permit system is üëç from me - the Green Lakes area has been heavily impacted for many years, and it will take a long time to recover. But we're giving it a chance now.
