[Out of shape. And a bunch of downed trees](https://www.strava.com/activities/4199933403)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 8.07     | 1:07:27 | 1:09:46      | 8:21 | 1406      |


Who maintains this trail? I'd like to get in touch and offer to do some of the work myself.

Also broke a shoelace.

I think there was a bit of GPS weirdness on this one too.
