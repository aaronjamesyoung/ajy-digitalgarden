[Three Fingered Jack loop](https://www.strava.com/activities/7639463086)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 27.31    | 4:28:26 | 5:16:14      | 9:49 | 3970      |


With an intentional out and back up Canyon Creek, and an unintentional out and back after missing a turn on the way down.

This is a super beautiful loop with amazing views. My thoughts:

Go counterclockwise. Nice smooth ending along the PCT.

Do the out and back up Canyon Creek to the meadow and tarn. Worth it.
