Oof. Thick smoke rolled in after I set up camp. I brought an N95 (as you do these days) and decided to see if it would let up. I couldn't sleep with that mask on and decided I'd be better off trying to improve my situation than sitting till morning. Took the shortest route home - still wearing that mask - and I'll try again some other time.
