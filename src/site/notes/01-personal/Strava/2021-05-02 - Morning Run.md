[Morning Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/5231843278)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 9        | 1:10:27 | 1:10:35      | 7:49 | 794       |


I had a stressful week and didn't feel great all week long, so it was good to have a decent run and hit 50 miles for the week.

Edit: I just checked and it's only 49.9 - there goes everything I guess
