After a break to let the April snow melt, it's another big one - I don't think I need to do 7 buttes in a single run anymore, but I didn't want to break up these into two runs.

The two up north have no name; they are both kind of "lumps with trees" but the first one has a few peekaboo views. The second one - the high point of the day - had the worst views of the day.

I then swung south by crossing the lava flow at a narrow spot. It wasn't long.... but never again! This was seriously stupid - too much opportunity to get injured. I regret it and should have run back out the long way.

The five buttes at the south end are tightly grouped and there are a bunch of dirt bike trails in the area, so I didn't need any more cross country travel with a couple minor exceptions. There's a half marathon race course in here somewhere.

The best butte of the day has no official name but has a sign at the top labeling it as "Jane Butte"... so I'm going with that! Amazing 360 degree views of lava flows and the mountains. This one was a big surprise. Otherwise not too many great views today, looking forward to some of the buttes I'll be hitting in the future.

All the up and down, plus cross-country travel, makes this a pretty hard effort even though it was slow.
