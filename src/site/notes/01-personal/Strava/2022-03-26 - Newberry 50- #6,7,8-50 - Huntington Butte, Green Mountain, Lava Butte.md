After a short snow delay in March, it's time to get going again. Today's lineup was three cinder cones just south of Bend. I didn't feel on top of it today but took it easy.

Huntington Butte requires a kind of long roundabout approach and doesn't have much of a view. There's a little weather station at the top and appears to be another shooting range at the cinder pit at the bottom (so approach with care).

Next I did Green Mountain. This is a fairly ambitious name for this hill. The trail from Lava Butte is unmarked but easy to follow. I approached by taking roads curling around to the north (lower) summit then a user trail to the south summit. The approach trail was a lot of fun but again there is no view at the top. I bushwhacked down the south side, which saved distance but I definitely wouldn't do again; it'd be easier to head out the trail and loop around.

Final one for the day was Lava Butte. This is a super cool butte with a great view and a crater. I was lucky to get a few minutes of sunshine between the clouds while at the top.
