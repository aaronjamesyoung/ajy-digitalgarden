[Heart of Darkness Loop fastpack, Day 1/2](https://www.strava.com/activities/7416600537)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 25.35    | 6:45:55 | 6:46:00      | 16:00 | 2639      |


Oh boy, where do I begin... This is a challenging loop. It's not just the elevation profile - although that's part of it - but also navigation and handling rough terrain. In places the trail is almost invisible, sometimes it's overgrown with brush, and there are rocks as well as cattle tracks in several places.

This is a beautiful loop though - it's wild and rugged. It's super green right now and the wildflowers are off the hook. It's very Ochoco with the big pines, open meadows, and exposed views.

Day 1 was Rock Creek trailhead to Tin Cup Creek, plus a summit of Spanish Peak which had amazing views.
