Back after 4 weeks forced break following surgery for testicular cancer. All went well and everything looks best case scenario - no followup treatment is needed and I'll have a ct scan in April. Guys, remember to check.

So in the meantime I'm easing back in, pretty conservatively until I figure out how everything is going to react. Good to be back at it!
