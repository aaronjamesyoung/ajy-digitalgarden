I wanted to get done with Cabin and Coyote Buttes early before the shooters got out - it's a popular unofficial shooting area. Somehow that turned into "let's catch sunrise on Coyote" so it was an early start.

I parked at Bessie Butte and ran toward Cabin, bagging it quickly and moving on. I got up Coyote just at the tail end of the sunrise. There was a camper at the top so I didn't stay too long. After this I hit Horse Butte, skirting around the crater, then took the Swamp Wells trail back to Bessie.

Bessie is one of the best 360 views in Central Oregon and today was awesome as usual. I even saw a bald eagle on the way up.

Pictures are... out of order? Wonder if I can fix that
