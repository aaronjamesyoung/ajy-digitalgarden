[First wolfslug sighting of 2021](https://www.strava.com/activities/5040546022)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 7.01     | 1:04:56 | 1:05:06      | 9:16 | 1366      |


This route should in no way be considered "open" yet. Still like 3 feet of snow at the top.

Also, there were two abandoned vehicles stuck up on Rotten road
