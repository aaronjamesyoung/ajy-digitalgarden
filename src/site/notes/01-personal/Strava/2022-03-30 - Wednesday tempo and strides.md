[Wednesday tempo and strides](https://www.strava.com/activities/6909407361)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 8.6      | 1:05:51 | 1:06:33      | 7:39 | 362       |


I don't really want structured training right now, but I do need to be a little more intentional. So I'm going to get a tempo day and a long day each week, and make a better effort to run slow on easy days.

15' w/up, 10' tempo, 5' easy, 5x90" fast strides w/ 3' rest, 15' c/down

I haven't done this in a while and I think I took it too hot especially at the start, but I'll have to see how I feel over the next couple days.
