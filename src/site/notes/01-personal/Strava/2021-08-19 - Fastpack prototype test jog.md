[Fastpack prototype test jog](https://www.strava.com/activities/5821310350)

| Distance | Time  | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 4.01     | 32:58 | 35:05        | 8:13 | 194       |


I put together a backpack which I intend to use for some 1-3 night fastpacking trips in the mountains. I used this pattern: https://www.stitchbackgear.com/patterns/stitchback-pz-sewing-pattern with some modifications:

- The biggest change is running vest style straps. I used Salomon style elastic cord across the sternum.
- I made the pack slightly smaller in depth (from my back to the back of the pack). The intention was to stabilize it a bit by having it not stick out as much.
- I added a removeable hip belt which was very helpful in stabilization
- I have a pocket on the exterior against my back where I plan to put a folded foam pad

I loaded it with around 8.5 pounds of gear and went out for a jog. It held together! It rides great when hiking and OK when running; a bit of bouncing and some side to side motion. I am getting some ideas for the changes I'd make next time, but for now I hope this will get me out there.
