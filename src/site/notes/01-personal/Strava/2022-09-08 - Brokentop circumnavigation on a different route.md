[Brokentop circumnavigation on a different route](https://www.strava.com/activities/7777192297)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 22.32    | 3:52:56 | 4:41:50      | 10:26 | 4325      |


Added a pretty big off trail section to visit Tam and Rim Lakes, then cut up to the Broken Hand and No Name Lake. Which is a really bad name for something that does, in fact, have a name.
