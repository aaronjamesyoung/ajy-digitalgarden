[AQI dipping below 100, so got in a low-intensity run](https://www.strava.com/activities/5744554307)

| Distance | Time  | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 5.81     | 45:58 | 48:19        | 7:54 | 475       |


Above around 100, the air is just too nasty for running. It's just not worth the lung damage to go outside.

I'm not sure if running low-intensity really makes much difference, but it feels like I... don't need to breathe as much?
