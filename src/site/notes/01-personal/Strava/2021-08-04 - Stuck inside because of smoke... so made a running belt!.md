Strava doesn't have a "sewing" activity so I picked the closest one I could find, which is kitesurfing.

I made a running belt to carry my phone and ID, and other basic trail running stuff. It's made of leftover silpoly and hex nylon from my backpacking tarp/tent project.

I used this pattern: https://learnmyog.com/runningBelt.html

The plan was to be backpacking up in the Three Sisters Wilderness today and tomorrow, but I'm staring outside at a 150+ AQI, so that's not happening and I'm stuck inside at home. So this was the next best option.
