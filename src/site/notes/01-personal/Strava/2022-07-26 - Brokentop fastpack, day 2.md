[Brokentop fastpack, day 2](https://www.strava.com/activities/7533651288)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 19       | 3:48:26 | 4:34:28      | 12:01 | 1194      |


Because of the mosquitos at Golden Lake, I got up and hiked up to the pass to have breakfast. Green Lakes and Brokentop trail were beautiful but there was some haze on the horizon and the heat was getting pretty strong. The route is basically snow free but there are some deadfalls in certain areas.
