[Afternoon Run](https://www.strava.com/activities/5988354971)

| Distance | Time  | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 5        | 41:54 | 46:25        | 8:22 | 708       |


I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but don't block official trails... this is the second time I've found logs and limbs placed across the Bridge Creek trail at the Swampy / Spring Creek intersection.

Easy-ish run today, need to recover a bit I guess.
