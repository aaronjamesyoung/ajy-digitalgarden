[Night Wolfslug](https://www.strava.com/activities/5541192618)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 6.96     | 1:00:00 | 1:03:52      | 8:36 | 1362      |


Tonight's score:
- Lots of bats. They sit on the road and their eyes reflect my headlamp then they fly away as I approach. (edit: after doing some more research, I think maybe this was nighthawks instead???)
- Lots of nighthawks that I could hear but not see
- One set of eyes staring at me from the woods ðŸ‘€
