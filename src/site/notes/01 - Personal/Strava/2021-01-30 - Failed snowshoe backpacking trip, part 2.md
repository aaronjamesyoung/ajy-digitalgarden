[Failed snowshoe backpacking trip, part 2](https://www.strava.com/activities/4708492411)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 9.08     | 3:42:31 | 4:46:33      | 24:31 | 795       |


I came back down to Tumalo Falls and decided to try to use the Farewell trail to get to my campsite. I was breaking trail in snowshoes from the bottom, and couldn't find the connector road I was looking for. Not interested in taking any risks wandering around in the forest in these conditions. Instead of camping, just headed down the hill and back home.

Some lessons learned on this one... be more careful assessing trail conditions, don't be too ambitious about snowshoe mileage since it's hard and slow. I also didn't want to fall back to a different campsite since I had told Evelyn exactly where I planned to be and didn't want to deviate from the route (and yes I was planning to hike this portion of Farewell; just was expecting to come down it tomorrow instead).

This was my first try at this and I'm sure I can do better next time.
