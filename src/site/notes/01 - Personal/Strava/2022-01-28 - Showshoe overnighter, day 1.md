[Showshoe overnighter, day 1](https://www.strava.com/activities/6601599661)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 7.3      | 2:26:52 | 2:52:25      | 20:06 | 1928      |


It was relatively easy to cover some distance with the crusty snow and the groomed snowmobile trails. Camped at Bottle Creek, which is normally a reliable water source in the summer, but is currently snowed over. I had to melt snow and used most of my fuel.

Tagging Tam McArthur Rim was a stretch goal for this one, but with the water situation I decided to make it a simpler out 'n' back.
