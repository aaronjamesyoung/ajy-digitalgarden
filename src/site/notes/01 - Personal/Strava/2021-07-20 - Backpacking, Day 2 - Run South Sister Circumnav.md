[Backpacking, Day 2 - Run South Sister Circumnav](https://www.strava.com/activities/5665864970)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 31.07    | 5:59:37 | 7:27:18      | 11:34 | 4732      |


I prepared my running pack, got up early, and started jogging north on the Green Lakes trail! It felt like I was losing way too much elevation on the way to the Camp Lake trail, and I had to gain it all back, and then some, over the next 7 miles. The area from Camp Lake to Chambers Lakes is lava rock and no trees - it feels like the moon and is really slow going. I crossed the Cascades crest (thus entering the Willamette Valley?) and went downhill steep to the PCT. With about five miles along the PCT through some amazing wildflowers and beautiful creek crossings, I turned off and made my way up to Moraine Lake then back to Green Lakes. The last 10 miles of the day were pretty hard, probably 7-8 of them were uphill and hot. I, uh, passed on the opportunity for a summit.

Winning gear: Single trekking pole. All the convenience of poles, but half the hassle.
