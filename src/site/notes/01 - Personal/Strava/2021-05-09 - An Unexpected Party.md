[An Unexpected Party](https://www.strava.com/activities/5270515918)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 16.6     | 2:06:07 | 2:08:10      | 7:35 | 1948      |


The top part of Ben's was closed, so I had to follow a detour over to Phil's in order to continue up instead of taking Pinedrops. First time over Helipad, steeper than I thought it'd be!
