So good to finally do this loop!

This was an interesting trip and I changed my plans a lot.

For this day, I was planning to go 25 miles to camp at Mesa Creek on the PCT. But I got there at 3pm, was feeling great, and decided to push through the next section. It was a great decision - the PCT is beautiful on a fall evening! The Obsidian area in particular is really nice. Nobody was out there and I just took it easy and kept moving.

Camped at Glacier Creek and it got cold quick in the evening!
