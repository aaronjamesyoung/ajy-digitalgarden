This was a big one and the offtrail stuff is slooooooow.

Kelsey Butte is approachable from the south - there's too much manzanita on the north. There's not really a trail but some footpaths. It has a surprisingly good view from the top and a bench.

Balbali was just cross-country climb through the woods! A little snow. Not much view at the top, but on the south side it's more open with good views.

The first unnamed butte I did today was actually one of the best of the day. It has a cool crater, a lava climb, and is relatively accessible even with no trail.

Ikt was another one climbing through the woods (and some snow) to a top without much view, but there is a stick at the summit and a geocache!

Klawhop was surprisingly awesome. It also has a fairly easy climb and some lava to traverse. It has two big craters - I went around the first one and between the craters. Lots of interesting terrain on this one, well worth the visit.

The second unnamed butte was the opposite. I must have zoned out while planning the route, because I had to bushwack through a giant manzanita belt. Once I got to the top, there was no view. I was like, "ok this is a thing I did" and moved on.

Luna might be the best one I've done yet. It has an easy climb (steep but there is a path the whole way) and the views are amazing in every direction.
