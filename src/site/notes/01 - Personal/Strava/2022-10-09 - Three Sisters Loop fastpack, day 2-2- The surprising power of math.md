[Three Sisters Loop fastpack, day 2/2: The surprising power of math](https://www.strava.com/activities/7942845916)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace  | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| 37.97    | 8:18:03 | 9:44:20      | 13:06 | 4338      |


Original plan: 32 miles from Mesa Creek to Golden Lake. Updated plan after adding distance yesterday: 25 miles from Glacier Creek to Green Lakes.

As I was climbing Green Lakes Pass from the north side, it occurred to me that I could add some distance, get my wife to pick me up at Tumalo Falls, and sleep in my own bed tonight. I decided not to, then decided to do it. What's an extra 13 miles?

It was a beautiful day - the NW section of the loop along the PCT is great and if you haven't been across the south of Brokentop in the evening light, you should. The last few miles were pretty tough and I was totally done at the end.
