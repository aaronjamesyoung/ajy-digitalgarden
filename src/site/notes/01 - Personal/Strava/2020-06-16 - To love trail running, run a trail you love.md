[To love trail running, run a trail you love](https://www.strava.com/activities/3626950428)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 8.23     | 1:03:36 | 1:03:51      | 7:43 | 640       |


No big hills or epic views... it's just a great running trail.

I was feeling tired and unmotivated for most of today. Sometimes the right thing to do is to take a day off, but sometimes it's better to get out on a trail like this with no pressure and let the legs loosen up, keep your eyes on the dirt in front of you, and watch the trees go by.
