| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |

Got smoked out on another trip. Smoke wasn't in the forecast at all but it blew in and I had a bail option so I took it. I think it was a good move - the smoke didn't clear till 4am and it would've been a rough night. One of these days I'll get a trip to stick!!

Day 2 plan was to cross the highway into the Three Sisters Wilderness, loop up to Moraine Lake, link to Green Lakes and across Brokentop, then home.
