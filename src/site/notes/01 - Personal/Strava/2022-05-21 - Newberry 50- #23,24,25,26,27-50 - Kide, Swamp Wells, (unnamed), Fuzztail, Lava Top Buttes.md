Took it fairly easy today. I'm over halfway through this thing. Pictures got out of order again?

Fuzztail Butte was the surprisingly awesome one of the day - a nice trail and a good view at the top. Lava Top Butte was amazing, and I knew it would be, but I was a bit rushed by some bad weather coming in. Lava Top is also the first one I haven't hit the true summit of - I needed to do some exposed lava climbing and I'm not really into that. I would like to go back to it sometime when I have more time and better weather.
