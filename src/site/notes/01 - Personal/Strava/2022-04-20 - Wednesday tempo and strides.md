[Wednesday tempo and strides](https://www.strava.com/activities/7015451018)

| Distance | Time    | Elapsed Time | Pace | Elevation |
| -------- | ------- | ------------ | ---- | --------- |
| 8.78     | 1:07:09 | 1:08:37      | 7:39 | 309       |


15' w/up
6' tempo, 3' easy
12' tempo, 5' easy
5 x 60" fast strides w/ 2:00 run between
15' c/d

Felt surprisingly good today. The First Street Rapids trail is good, but not great, for this kind of work
