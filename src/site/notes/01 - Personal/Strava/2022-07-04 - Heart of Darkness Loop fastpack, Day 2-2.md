Still beautiful and still tough. Slow trails from the start. The Black Canyon trail is ridiculously overgrown and I lost it a few times. It is good after the intersection with Coffee Pot trail but I definitely had a slow few miles in there. About 4 miles of road to get back to my car at the finish.
