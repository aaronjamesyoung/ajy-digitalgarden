In October 2021 I was diagnosed with a form of testicular cancer. It was removed surgically and I have needed no further treatment.

I have had an easier experience with this than pretty much anyone else and I've pretty much breezed through my followup appointments. So I've been quite lucky.

I thought I would have more to say on this right now, but I'm sure I will later.
